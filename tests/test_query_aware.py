"""Query-aware salience: distil keeps the tool-output line the agent asked about.

distil is a proxy, so it holds the agent's intent (its tool_use args + latest ask) in
the same request as the output being compressed. This exercises the whole live path:
extract_intent(messages) -> compress_messages -> digest(intent=...), and the additive
+ selectivity invariants the spec promises. See distil/compress/intent.py and tier1.digest.
