# Changelog

All notable changes to Distil are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [1.13.0] — 1.13.0rc3 — seamless hot-swap: upgrades apply to live sessions, no restart

### Fixed

- Shadow health no longer shows a red `✗` degraded verdict before the A/A noise
  baseline exists. `adjusted_rate()` silently falls back to the raw, un-adjusted
  rate when there is no baseline, so the status line was painting sampling
  nondeterminism as compression harm (e.g. a scary `✗de 36.0%` over 25 samples
  with a 3/10 baseline). The verdict glyph now gates on `aa_agreement()` and
  shows a neutral `de baseline N/10` while warming; `shadow-stats --json` nulls
  its `adjusted_*` fields until the baseline lands instead of labelling raw
  values "adjusted". Display-only — never affected routing, compression, or
  savings.

### Added

- **Seamless proxy hot-swap** (POSIX, on by default): `distil wrap` now runs the
  proxy as a supervised subprocess on a wrap-owned listener FD. When
  `pipx upgrade` (or pip) puts a new version on disk, the wrap spawns a fresh
  worker — new code, same socket, same port — health-checks it, then drains the
  old one: in-flight requests (including long LLM streams) finish on the old
  worker while new requests land on the new one. The agent session never
  restarts and its `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` never changes.
  - Zero request-path overhead: supervision is out-of-band; the upgrade poll is
    one metadata read every 30 s in a daemon thread.
  - Fail-safe twice over: a worker that doesn't report ready is discarded and
    the old one keeps serving; a supervisor that can't start falls back to the
    historical in-thread proxy. The feature can never cost a session.
  - A worker that *dies* mid-session (crash/OOM) is respawned automatically —
    the same self-heal contract the in-thread accept loop had.
  - Manual trigger: `kill -USR1 <wrap pid>`. Opt out: `DISTIL_HOT_SWAP=0`.
  - Windows keeps the in-thread proxy and the existing skew warning (FD
    inheritance is POSIX-only — same accepted platform split as file locking).
- `distil proxy-worker` (internal) — the supervised worker entry point.
- `distil upgrade` now says which sessions hot-swap on their own instead of
  telling you to restart everything.

## [1.12.0] — soaking as 1.12.0rc4 since 2026-07-06 — statusline honesty round 3: "✓ on" means traffic actually flows

First release through the new rc + soak pipeline (runtime code → rc first).

### Added (post-rc4, headed for rc5)

- **OpenTelemetry GenAI spans** (opt-in): `pip install 'distil-llm[otel]'` emits
  `gen_ai.*` semantic-convention spans per proxied request with
  `distil.tokens.original/compressed`, `distil.compression.ratio`, and
  `distil.shadow.sampled` attributes. Strict no-op without the extra; an OTel
  failure can never break the request path. Core stays zero-dependency.
- **Supply chain**: CycloneDX SBOM attached to GitHub releases; weekly OpenSSF
  Scorecard on `main`; PEP 740 Sigstore attestations confirmed active.
- **docs/EVALUATION.md**: the evaluation methodology — why compression ratio
  without a task-success delta is meaningless, the E7 negative result, the A/A
  nondeterminism baseline, and what the trajectory certificate does/doesn't prove.

### Fixed (post-rc4, headed for rc5)

- **CI red on `main` since 1.11.2 — test-side, not product**: the wrap signal
  tests synchronized on fixed sleeps and lost the race on loaded CI runners
  (SIGTERM landing before the handler installs kills the wrap raw). Children
  now write a readiness marker after arming; tests wait on it.
- **`shadow.jsonl` appends now flocked** like `ledger.json` — shadow is
  on-by-default since rc3 and rc4 rows exceed the size where bare appends are
  atomic; concurrent sessions can no longer tear rows.
- `distil doctor` no longer silently drops a crashed Claude Code check —
  it reports FAIL like every other check.

### Fixed
- **"✓ on" no longer trusts env vars alone — a wrapped agent that bypasses the proxy is
  called out.** Found live: a claude.ai-subscription (OAuth) Claude Code session keeps
  `DISTIL_SESSION` and the loopback `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in its env yet sends model calls
  straight to api.anthropic.com (verified with lsof: direct TLS to the provider, zero
  ledger rows, proxy healthy). The 1.11.1 honesty fix checked routing *setup*; this one
  checks routing *reality*. `distil wrap` now writes a per-session traffic marker
  (`~/.distil/sessions/<sid>`, "0" at start), the proxy's first proxied request flips it
  to "1", and a marker still at "0" after a 3-minute grace shows
  **"⚠ wrapped, agent bypassing proxy"** (minimal mode: "⚠ bypassed") instead of "✓ on".
  Markers are single-writer (no locking), best-effort (never block the wrap), swept
  after 7 days, and standalone `distil proxy` never fabricates one.

### Added
- **A/A noise baseline makes the de number interpretable (rc4).** Soak found raw
  compressed-vs-full agreement at 47% — alarming until you notice the comparator's bar
  is "same tool with identical normalized arguments" under live sampling: the model
  disagrees with *itself* on identical requests (a Bash command worded two ways is a
  "changed decision" with zero compression involvement). A third of shadow samples now
  replay the SAME compressed request twice, measuring self-agreement; the statusline
  de rate is reported relative to that baseline, and `distil shadow-stats` shows the
  full decomposition (raw / self-agreement / adjusted). Shadow rows also carry
  content-free evidence now — request digest + both decision signatures — so any
  divergence is diagnosable instead of a bare `false`.
- **Shadow decision-equivalence sampling is on by default (rc3): 2% of wrap requests.**
  It was opt-in (`--shadow`, default 0) — so nobody ran it, the statusline's `de 1/25`
  counter sat frozen for a week implying live measurement, and the launch gate's
  "✓de ≥ 99% at n ≥ 25" evidence could never accrue. Per the intelligence-is-the-default
  rule the flag is now an opt-out: `--shadow 0` disables, `--shadow 0.1` collects faster.
  Cost is explicit: a sampled request is re-run uncompressed for comparison, so the
  default adds ~2% tokens.
- **Wrap-signal breadcrumbs (rc3).** Tonight's quit produced no `.exit` file — because
  the killer took out the wrap *with* the child (process-group kill; terminal-tab SIGHUP),
  so the child-exit path never ran. The wrap's SIGTERM/SIGHUP handler now appends
  "wrap received SIGNAME" to the `.exit` file before dying — the only trace a group kill
  leaves. Both lines together read as a story: `wrap received SIGTERM; child exit 143`.
- **Child-exit breadcrumb (rc2).** Soak day 1 hit a recurring silent agent quit — no
  crash report, no error in the transcript, no way to tell an OOM abort from a clean
  exit after the fact. The wrap is the only witness, so it now records how the child
  ended (`~/.distil/sessions/<sid>.exit`: "exit code N" / "signal NAME" + timestamp);
  `scripts/soak-report.sh` prints it per session.
- **Terminal private-mode reset on wrap exit (rc2).** A crashed TUI leaves xterm modes
  on that `tcsetattr` can't undo — mouse reporting (the `65;76;9M` junk on click),
  bracketed paste, the alternate screen, a hidden cursor. The wrap's restore now resets
  them explicitly; all idempotent on clean exits.
- Test-env hygiene: `tests/conftest.py` sandboxes `DISTIL_HOME` and strips the inherited
  `DISTIL_SESSION` for every test — dogfooding developers run the suite from wrapped
  terminals, and no test may touch the real `~/.distil`.

## [1.11.4] — 2026-07-05 — Release hardening: chaos suite in CI, rc + soak policy, launch gate

No runtime code changed in this release — it hardens the process that ships the runtime.
The 1.10.0→1.11.3 day (six releases, each fixing the previous, all correct in review and
wrong under real use) showed the release gate was blind to signal/lifecycle chaos and had
no bake time. Both gaps close here. (Per the new soak policy this release is soak-exempt:
tests/CI/docs/tooling only.)

### Added
- **Chaos suite in CI** (`tests/test_chaos.py`): the ad-hoc harnesses used to verify the
  1.11.3 Ctrl+C fix are now permanent, bounded tests that run on every push —
  a ~400-signal sustained SIGINT hammer against `distil wrap` with a live child (pins the
  1.11.3 immune-parent property; the 1.11.2 structure fails this), and a
  crash-the-accept-loop test proving the wrap proxy self-heals and keeps answering on the
  same port (the 1.11.0 self-heal path was previously untested).
- **rc + soak release policy** (RELEASING.md): any release that changes runtime behavior
  ships as `X.Y.ZrcN` first and bakes ≥ 3 days on real traffic before the final. rc tags
  are fully wired: GitHub release marked prerelease, PyPI gets the rc (pip ignores
  prereleases unless `--pre`), Homebrew and the Docker image skip rcs, `release.sh`
  detects rc versions and adjusts its preflight (changelog entry lives under the final).
- **Launch gate** (docs/GA_READINESS.md): a binary, evidence-based checklist separating
  engineering GA from the marketing launch — 14 quiet days at head, external beta, live
  decision-equivalence at n ≥ 25 from multiple users, human fresh-install walkthrough on
  all three OSes, claims re-audit at the launch commit.

### Fixed
- **Statusline `de` honesty (rc3, honesty gap #3).** A sub-25 sample count now shows
  `de n/25` only while the shadow ledger was fed within the last 24h; otherwise
  `de idle` — a frozen counter must not read as live measurement.
- **Signal-handler breadcrumb wrote an empty file (rc3).** `_signal_breadcrumb` used
  `time.strftime` but `proxy.py` only imported `time` inside `wrap_run` — the NameError
  was swallowed by the handler's best-effort except, leaving a created-but-empty `.exit`.
  Caught by the new SIGHUP test; `time` is now a module-level import.
- **`release.yml` would have served an rc to everyone.** A `v*rc*` tag previously bumped
  the Homebrew tap and pushed the Docker image as `latest` — both now final-only, and the
  GitHub release for an rc is marked prerelease.

## [1.11.3] — 2026-07-05 — Ctrl+C fix, take two: the wrap parent is now immune to SIGINT entirely

### Fixed
- **Rapid Ctrl+C could still kill a wrapped session (escape path in the 1.11.2 fix).** 1.11.2 caught the Ctrl+C `KeyboardInterrupt` only while blocked in `proc.wait()`; a press landing while the parent was executing the except clause itself (users mash Ctrl+C — Claude Code literally prompts "press ctrl-c again", and a held key auto-repeats) escaped the loop, tore the proxy down under the live agent, and killed the session on its next API call. Reproduced under a SIGINT hammer: the 1.11.2 structure died after ~1.7k signals with the agent still alive; the new one survived 1.7M. The wrap parent now installs a no-op SIGINT handler for its lifetime — immune to any number and timing of presses. A Python-level handler (unlike `SIG_IGN`) resets to default across `exec`, so the agent still receives its Ctrl+C normally (verified empirically). SIGTERM keeps terminate-child + flush-savings + exit semantics.
- `scripts/release.sh`: dropped the stale `distil/__init__.py` version-literal check — the literal was removed when the version became single-sourced from `pyproject.toml`, so the check could only fail.

## [1.11.2] — 2026-07-05 — Ctrl+C no longer kills wrapped sessions; fresh-install statusline honesty

### Fixed
- **Ctrl+C no longer tears down the proxy under a live agent.** A terminal Ctrl+C is delivered to the whole foreground process group; agents like Claude Code survive the first press (it cancels the turn, not the app), but `distil wrap` treated it as shutdown — exiting and leaving the agent pointed at a dead port, so the session died on its next API call. The wrap now keeps waiting through SIGINT (the child owns that signal); SIGTERM keeps its terminate-child + flush-savings + exit semantics.
- **Statusline honesty for fresh installs.** A routed session (`distil wrap` env present) with an empty ledger was told to run `distil wrap -- <agent>` — the exact state every new user hits first. It now shows "✓ on · no savings yet"; the wrap hint remains only for genuinely unrouted shells.
- **Alias-mode verify hint fixed.** `distil default` told users to check `echo $ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, which is empty by design in alias mode (the URL is injected only into the wrapped agent's env). It now says `type <agent>` (should show the distil wrap alias); the env-var check applies to `--always-on` only.

## [1.11.1] — 2026-07-05 — Statusline honesty, pre-1.10 warning in terminal, `distil reset`

### Added
- **`distil reset`** — archives the savings ledger to `savings.jsonl.reset-<utc>` (non-destructive, auditable) and starts fresh on post-1.10 accounting; `--shadow` also resets decision-equivalence stats. For ledgers dominated by pre-1.10 records whose savings may be overstated.

### Fixed
- **Statusline honesty: "✓ on" now means routed.** The idle segment said "✓ on" even in a session whose requests went straight to the provider (no `distil wrap`, no loopback base URL). Unrouted sessions now show "off — session not routed".
- **Pre-1.10 overstatement warning reaches the terminal.** `distil stats` text output now prints the legacy-accounting footnote (was HTML-only, despite the 1.10 changelog claim), with a pointer to `distil reset`.
- Windows: `distil default --undo` test no longer assumes a service manager exists (none is wired on Windows).

## [1.11.0] — 2026-07-05 — Ops-ready: debuggable fail-open, crash-safe accounting, health probes; claims audit

### Added
- **`GET /distil/health`** on all three entry points (sync proxy, async proxy, gateway): unauthenticated liveness probe for load balancers / k8s readiness checks. Answers locally — never touches the billed upstream.
- **Debug escape hatch for fail-open paths.** `DISTIL_DEBUG=1` (or `DISTIL_LOG_LEVEL=<level>`) logs every swallowed compression/learning/shadow exception to stderr with a traceback, via a `distil` logger that never touches the root logger. Silent-by-default is unchanged.
- **Restore-store TTL.** Digest originals in `~/.distil/restore/` now age out after `DISTIL_RESTORE_TTL_DAYS` (default 14, `0` disables), on top of the existing 500-file count cap — plaintext agent content no longer sits on disk indefinitely under low traffic.
- Windows CI job (`windows-latest`, 3.12) — the classifier says OS Independent; now the fcntl/termios/SIGPIPE guards are actually exercised.

### Fixed
- **Gateway accounting is crash-safe.** Per-tenant counters now checkpoint to disk at most every 30 s during traffic (atomic replace), not only in the graceful-shutdown path — a `kill -9`/OOM loses ≤ 30 s of accounting instead of everything since startup.
- **MCP store race.** Two concurrent `distil_compress` tool calls could interleave load/save and silently drop one handle (later `distil_expand` on it failed). The read-modify-write now runs under an advisory lock, same pattern as the savings ledger.
- **`distil wrap` proxy self-heals.** If the embedded proxy's accept loop ever crashes, it logs and restarts instead of leaving the wrapped agent with connection-refused for the rest of the session.

### Changed
- **Claims tightened to what the artifacts back** (audit follow-up): "only Distil *certifies* the reversible tier" (Headroom ships an uncertified retrieve — the old wording overclaimed "offers"); the ~1,000× speed multiple now carries its no-ML-model-vs-transformer-inference framing at first mention; LLMLingua-2's SWE-bench row notes only 16/500 runs completed; the Rust core is labeled build-from-source (published wheels run the pure-Python engine).

## [1.10.1] — 2026-07-05 — Review follow-ups

### Fixed
- **No more 0-savings ledger rows.** A flush window that saved nothing (typical under `--lossless-only`) no longer writes a ledger row — session ledgers stay signal-only. Request accounting elsewhere is unchanged.
- **Dedup markers are expand-recoverable.** The `«repeat of earlier tool output …»` marker now carries the `handle=` form that `distil expand` keys on, resolving to the byte-exact original.

### Changed
- **One statusline label for decision-equivalence.** `de 12/25` while collecting → `✓de 99.5% (n)` at 25+ samples (was `eq` for the rate form).

## [1.10.0] — 2026-07-05 — Production hardening: truly lossless, honest accounting, lifecycle fixes

### Fixed

- **`--lossless-only` is now truly lossless (no Tier-1 stubs).** Previously a Tier-1 reversible digest stub could appear in a lossless-only session — but without an injected expand tool the agent could never recover it, making the stub effectively irreversible. The flag now folds directly into verbatim (Tier-0-only) at all three proxy entry points (`aproxy`, `proxy`, `gateway`). No separate `--verbatim` flag needed.
- **Recoverable digests everywhere.** All four digest forms (Tier-1, columnar, template, skeleton) now emit `handle=` markers backed by the RestoreStore. Originals persist to `~/.distil/restore/` (respecting `DISTIL_HOME`) and survive proxy restarts — `distil expand <handle>` works across sessions.
- **Honest savings accounting (numbers dip — that means they became correct).** Records are booked only after a confirmed 2xx response; failed or retried requests are no longer counted. New ledger rows carry `acct:2`; mixed-era ledgers print a footnote: "(includes N records from pre-1.10 accounting — savings may be overstated)". The cache simulator is now write-once-then-read, eliminating a double-counting path.
- **Terminal corruption fixed.** `distil wrap` now saves and restores the terminal state (`termios`) on exit, so a wrapped agent that dies mid-output no longer leaves the terminal in raw mode.
- **Upgrade version-skew warning.** `distil upgrade` now detects running proxy/wrap/gateway processes and warns to restart them — a live proxy loaded pre-upgrade modules can hit a version-skew crash on lazy import mid-request.
- **Decision-equivalence in statusline.** The `✓/⚠/✗ eq <rate>% (n)` display now appears only at ≥ 25 shadow samples; below that threshold it is suppressed everywhere (statusline, leaderboard, doctor, dashboard) — a rate over a handful of samples is noise, not a guarantee.
- **Ledger resilience.** Corrupt lines are tolerated (skipped with a warning rather than crashing the whole read), cross-process writes use advisory file locking, and a backup is kept on each write cycle.
- **Gateway persistence and tenant cap enforced at state load.** Per-tenant accounting persists across restarts; the tenant cap is checked at state-load time, not only at request time.

### Added

- `tests/test_live_certified_equivalence.py` — pins the live proxy's compression decisions to the certified strategy, making any drift a visible, reviewed change. The one documented intentional delta: a recency carve-out keeps the last few tool-result turns verbatim so the agent always sees its freshest output byte-exact.

## [1.8.1] — 2026-07-04 — Believe-it UX + honest ▼0

### Fixed
- **Statusline session view**: shows THIS session first (`▼75.0K −62% $0.31`),
  lifetime as one `Σ` figure; theme-proof 256-color palette + ✓/⚠/✗ health
  glyphs (basic magenta rendered unreadable on dark themes); a session with
  traffic but nothing trimmed yet reads `watching · N seen`, not `▼0 −0%`.
- **▼0 self-explains**: every compressed response carries `x-distil-mode` +
  `x-distil-compressible-tokens`; `distil doctor` warns when the always-on
  proxy runs in verbatim (which caps savings near zero by design).
- Ledger records carry a session id; proxy no longer writes zero-baseline records.

### Added
- Landing hero: two-door router + a real terminal proof card; benchmark chart
  in the hero; site-wide editorial layering (both audiences, less prose).
- `distil stats --badge` (shareable measured-savings badge); LAUNCH.md.

### Docs / process
- E14 propagated to ALL paper artifacts (main.pdf, NeurIPS variant, PAPER.md);
  paper-build now rebuilds + commits PDFs on push to main so they can't drift.

## [1.8.2] — 2026-07-04 — GA polish: no papercuts

### Fixed
- **No raw tracebacks on bad input.** A missing/malformed input file across
  8 commands dumped a Python stack trace; one guard at the dispatch point now
  prints a clean `distil <cmd>: <error>` and exits 2.
- **`--help` no longer lists commands that don't exist** (expand/sweep/gate/
  corpus/adaptive were phantom); a regression test fails if any return.
- **One installer-detection source of truth** (`onboard.install_method`):
  `upgrade`, `offboard`, and `doctor` all use it, so upgrade/uninstall hints
  are always the runnable command (brew/pipx/uv/pip-with-venv-caveat) — no
  more bare `pip` that PEP 668 blocks.
- **`distil doctor` detects shadowed installs** (two `distil` on PATH) and
  **verbatim mode** — the two traps that made "▼0" or "upgrade didn't take".

### Added
- `distil version` (the word people type) and `distil upgrade` (installer-aware).
- World-class README hero (runnable terminal proof block); figures in PAPER.md;
  Homebrew tap auto-bumps on release; GHCR image + PDFs auto-rebuilt on push.

## [1.8.3] — 2026-07-04 — Latest & greatest: statusline, plain-English docs, self-service

### Added
- **Redesigned status line** — rich by default (`distil · session ▼7.8K · 4% smaller · $0.31 · total ▼27.0M · ✓eq 99%`), the session number pops in bold green; `DISTIL_STATUSLINE=minimal` for crowded composite lines. Clear session/total labels, `N% smaller` (no misleading `−`), cohesive teal/green palette.
- **`distil version`** and **`distil upgrade`** (auto-detects brew/pipx/uv/pip).
- Landing page: a plain-English "How it works" section for non-technical readers.

### Fixed
- `distil doctor` flags shadowed installs (two `distil` on PATH) and verbatim mode.
- `distil offboard` prints the uninstall command that actually works per installer (no bare `pip` that PEP 668 blocks).
- No raw tracebacks on bad input; `--help` no longer lists commands that don't exist.
- One installer-detection source of truth (`onboard.install_method`).

### Docs
- Lean README (~40% less prose) + live/clickable badges; 18-page site polish; every link verified; PAPER.md figures; honest banner.

## [1.8.4] — 2026-07-04 — Statusline polish + landing/docs GA audit

### Changed
- **Status line** fully colored (cohesive teal→green, no gray): session number pops bold green, trim rate mid-teal, total muted teal. `N% smaller` (not a misleading `−N%`).
- **Version single-sourced** — `__init__` reads pyproject instead of a hardcoded literal (no drift, no merge-back conflicts).

### Fixed (docs, proactive audit)
- Landing page: `Python 3.11+`→`3.9+` (factual); heading hierarchy; two "How it works"→ one is "Under the hood"; proof section now cites E14 (42.0% vs 39.2%); plain-English section linked from nav + hero; smart quotes.
- benchmark.html cites E14; getting-started smart quotes + stale version example.

## [1.8.5] — 2026-07-04 — Statusline clarity + self-diagnosing doctor

### Fixed
- **Statusline no longer flickers across terminals.** `distil default` spawns a proxy+session per terminal; the live ▼ now aggregates a 15-minute activity WINDOW across ALL sessions instead of one flickering "latest session".
- **Zero-savings state is unmistakable:** `✓ on · waiting for a large read` (bright green, clearly active) instead of a dim, easily-misread "watching".
- **`distil doctor` self-diagnoses the two traps:** `live routing` warns when a wrap/proxy is running but no traffic is recorded (agent bypassing distil); `this session` explains the watching state.

## [1.8.6] — 2026-07-04 — GA presentation + full-surface audit

Rendered every user-facing surface and fixed everything found — the engine was
already proven solid (an evidence-based runtime audit came back clean).

### Fixed — presentation & consistency
- **Status line**: ONE pattern in every state (`distil · <live> · total ▼<lifetime>`);
  live = 15-min window across ALL terminals (no session flicker); zero-savings
  reads `✓ on · waiting for a large read` (never a broken-looking `▼0 −0%`);
  all-teal palette, no gray.
- **No tracebacks on bad input** anywhere — added `NotADirectoryError` to the
  dispatch guard (a `--corpus` pointing at a file leaked a traceback on 6
  commands); `perf --iterations 0` and `holdout --control-fraction` out of range
  now give clean errors; `ingest` no longer silently 'succeeds' on garbage.
- **decision-equivalence suppressed below 25 samples EVERYWHERE** (status line,
  leaderboard, doctor, dashboard, shadow-stats) — no 100% guarantee off n=1.
- Dollars 2dp (or notional on a subscription); correct singular/plural
  (`1 request`/`1 sample`/`1 matched trajectory`); `online` shows `87.3%` not
  16 digits; certify `p=<0.0001` not `p=0`.
- **`distil default` now says: RESTART your agent** — the #1 onboarding trap
  (an agent started before the alias bypasses distil → savings stay at zero).
  `distil doctor` also flags this (`live routing`) and explains the `watching`
  state (`this session`).

### Docs
- Statusline state table (saving / watching / idle) in README + Integrations;
  proof-first hero everywhere (dropped the unmeasured "in half"); technique
  numbering aligned CLI↔site.

## [1.9.1] — 2026-07-04 — Quiet client disconnects

### Fixed
- **No more traceback spam on client disconnects**: agents (Claude Code
  especially) reset/abandon connections constantly — cancelled streams,
  retries, statusline polls — and every one dumped a full
  `ConnectionResetError: [Errno 54]` stack trace into the terminal running
  `distil wrap`/`proxy`/`gateway`. All three servers now run on a
  `QuietHTTPServer` that silently drops `ConnectionResetError` /
  `BrokenPipeError` / `ConnectionAbortedError`; real errors still print.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-07-04 — Per-session savings + hardened CI

### Added
- **True per-session status line** (the headline UX): each terminal now shows
  ITS OWN session's savings (`distil · ▼30.0K · 60% smaller`), while `total`
  stays lifetime across all sessions. `distil wrap` stamps a `DISTIL_SESSION`
  id inherited by both the proxy (which tags every ledger record) and the agent
  → the status line it spawns — so attribution is exact, with no cross-terminal
  bleed. A fresh terminal reads `✓ on` until it compresses something. The
  `distil dashboard` mirrors the same per-session view.

### Changed
- **Sharper positioning everywhere** (README, docs site, social image): dropped
  the "statistical fidelity certificate" jargon → *"Every other compressor asks
  you to trust it won't break your agent. Distil is the only one that proves it
  won't."* The E14 result reframed as a win — *"compressed context didn't just
  match the full context — it beat it: 42.0% vs 39.2%."*

### Quality
- **95% test coverage** (was a 78% floor), 1140+ tests: the CLI, status line,
  doctor, ledger, the network layer (proxy / gateway / streamrelay / async
  proxy), and the statistical-certificate paths are all exercised. Genuinely
  external code (the torch training loop, live-model proof-harness runners) is
  documented-and-omitted, not hidden.
- Fixed a Python-3.9-only flaky proxy-timeout test and a `$HOME`-dependent test
  that failed in a clean CI environment; the coverage floor now ratchets at 95%.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-07-04 — GA: compression that beats full context, certified

### Headline result (E14, SWE-bench Verified n=500, official harness)
- The v1.7 **surprise-preserving digest resolves 42.0% of tasks vs full
  context's 39.2%** (+2.8pp, paired CI [−0.6, +6.2]pp — statistically
  non-inferior with the point estimate above full) and +5.2pp over the E8
  head-digest gate. The shipped trajectory certificate certifies it
  (α=0.10, observed degradation 6.2%). Mechanism confirmed end-to-end:
  keeping a traceback's tail preserves the anomaly the next action needs.
  Paper §E14; `docs/compare.html`.

### Added
- **GA container image**: `ghcr.io/dshakes/distil` (amd64+arm64), published
  on release tags. Multi-stage, non-root, gate-verified.
- **Session-first statusline**: this session leads (`▼75.0K −62% $0.31`),
  lifetime collapses to `Σ27.0M`; compact composite-friendly grammar;
  theme-proof 256-color palette with ✓/⚠/✗ health glyphs; equivalence shown
  only at 25+ shadow samples (a rate over a handful of samples is noise).
- **`distil stats --badge`** — shareable shields.io badge of your measured
  savings; ledger records carry a session id (`ledger.summary(session=)`).
- **Decision-equivalence + session cards** on the HTML savings page and a
  session row in the TUI dashboard.
- **Claude Code plugin 1.8**: `/distil-certify` and `/distil-badge` commands;
  full command table on the Integrations page.
- **E14 benchmark condition** (`distil_gated_surprise`) + committed results,
  paper section, and macro generator.
- `docs/compare.html` (honest head-to-head), LiteLLM Proxy recipe,
  compliance-teams section, THREAT_MODEL.md, LAUNCH.md.

### Fixed
- Homebrew tap served 0.24.0 (pre-GA) — bumped to current and verified.
- `ledger.default_path()` honors `DISTIL_HOME`; forward path never follows
  redirects; identity encoding on compressible requests; 411 on chunked
  bodies; gateway stops echoing the anon tenant hash; mypy-clean package
  with typecheck + coverage floor in CI.



## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-03 — The trajectory-level certificate, true streaming, trust-critical savings fixes

### Added
- **Trajectory-level risk certificate** (`distil certify-trajectories`,
  `distil.certify.trajectory_risk`): certify the invariant that actually
  transfers to task success — a distribution-free Conformal Risk Control /
  Learn-Then-Test bound on **end-to-end task degradation** over matched
  full-context/compressed runs, with stated exchangeability assumptions,
  small-sample refusal, and an anytime-valid drift monitor that flags when the
  certificate needs recalibration. This is the corrected certificate target:
  per-step next-action equivalence provably overpredicts multi-step success
  (our E7 experiment; arXiv 2412.17483).
- **Outcome-guided compression policy** (`distil.compress.guideline`):
  ACON-style learning from trajectory outcomes — content classes whose
  digestion co-occurs with end-to-end regressions get protected byte-exact.
  Never-regressing by construction (only makes compression more conservative);
  content-free signatures only; always on in the proxy.
- **Surprise-preserving retention**: a fourth salience signal — error lines,
  failures, anomalies, and unified-diff changes are over-retained (the "lost
  if surprise" failure mode of lossy compressors), plus file-path protection.
- **True streaming pass-through** in all three servers (proxy, async proxy,
  gateway): SSE responses relay chunk-by-chunk, preserving time-to-first-token
  (previously every response was buffered start-to-finish). Shadow-mode
  decision-equivalence accounting tees off the streamed bytes.
- **`--json` output** on `doctor`, `leaderboard`/`stats`, and `shadow-stats`;
  a `stats` alias for `leaderboard`; grouped `distil --help`.
- **Doctor checks** for pricing-catalog drift (unpriced models in the ledger)
  and tokenizer grade (heuristic vs billing-grade counts).

### Fixed
- **Savings were priced at one fixed model.** The proxy now accounts each
  request under the model it names (mixed Opus/Haiku sessions are no longer
  all priced at the Opus rate), the pricing catalog covers current model ids
  (dated/Bedrock/Vertex shapes resolve too), and unknown upstreams (e.g.
  Gemini) record token savings with dollars=0 rather than being silently
  billed at Claude rates. The async proxy now records savings at all.
- **One-liner `def f(): pass` functions vanished from code skeletons**,
  leaving orphaned `...` where the signature should be.
- **`--shape-output` broke against the Anthropic API** (injected
  `role:"system"` into `messages`, which `/v1/messages` rejects); the
  directive now goes into the top-level `system` field on Anthropic bodies.
- **Upstream calls had no timeout** — a wedged upstream pinned a worker
  thread forever; now a finite (env-tunable) timeout maps to a 504.
- **Savings flushed only every 50 requests and were dropped on `kill`** —
  now every 10 requests or 30 s, plus a SIGTERM handler that flushes (and
  forwards the signal to the wrapped agent).
- **Gateway tenant identity trusted a client header** — accounting identity
  now derives from the credential hash; `x-distil-tenant` is honored only
  under `--trust-tenant-header`. `/distil/stats` and `/distil/dashboard`
  require `--admin-token` (Bearer) and are refused on non-loopback binds
  without one. The MCP handle store is bounded and chmod 0600.
- Concurrency race in expand-mode learning stats (intermittent 500s), sparse
  record arrays no longer fold ambiguously, delta replay order is a declared
  field with a loud error on mismatched turns, salience re-injection keeps
  indentation, `online` warns when reporting train-set metrics.

### Changed
- **Status line is now glanceable**: shows the percent trimmed next to the token
  figure (`1.2M→0.5M tok −58%`), a single `$X.XX saved` delta instead of two
  dollar figures, and colors decision-equivalence by health (green ≥99%,
  yellow ≥95%, red below) so a fidelity regression is visible at a glance.
- **`distil stats`** now prints the orig→compressed token totals with the percent
  trimmed and the live decision-equivalence (with shadow sample count) alongside
  the dollar totals.

## [1.6.2] — 2026-06-30 — Consistent version reporting

### Fixed
- **`distil --version` (and `distil doctor`) reported `1.6.0` on the 1.6.1 release.**
  The version lived in two places and only `pyproject` was bumped, so the published
  wheel's `__version__` lagged. Now single-sourced: `distil.__version__` reads the
  installed distribution metadata (`importlib.metadata`), so the CLI can never drift
  from the published package again. 1.6.2 carries the same Python 3.9+ fix as 1.6.1.

## [1.6.1] — 2026-06-30 — Installable on Python 3.9+ (fixes "from versions: none")

### Fixed
- **`pipx install distil-llm` / `pip install distil-llm` failed with `Could not find
  a version that satisfies the requirement distil-llm (from versions: none)` on stock
  macOS.** Root cause: `requires-python` was `>=3.11`, but macOS ships Python 3.9 as
  the system `python3`, so pip filtered out every release and reported that misleading
  message. The package is stdlib-only and uses `from __future__ import annotations`,
  so it already imports and passes the `distil bench` gate on 3.9/3.10 — the floor was
  simply set too high.
- **Lowered the floor to Python 3.9** (`requires-python = ">=3.9"`, classifiers added)
  and aligned `distil doctor`'s version check. CI now runs the full suite + gate on
  3.9–3.13 so the support claim stays true. Docs/troubleshooting updated.
  > Reaches users once **1.6.1 is published to PyPI** (the live 1.6.0 still pins
  > `>=3.11`). Publish by pushing a `v1.6.1` tag.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-30 — Onboard ensures everything

### Added
- **`distil onboard` now ensures you have everything — including a permanent
  install.** When run ephemerally (e.g. `uvx --from distil-llm distil onboard`),
  distil isn't on PATH, so onboard detects that and **offers to install distil
  permanently first** (pipx/uv/brew, per your machine) before wiring the status
  line and routing your agent. Makes `uvx --from distil-llm distil onboard` a true
  one-command setup. Intelligent by default — no flag to opt in.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-30 — Clean teardown

### Added
- **`distil offboard` — remove distil's footprint, the inverse of `onboard`.**
  Undoes the shell default (alias/env block), stops + removes the always-on proxy
  service, and unwires the status line from Claude Code settings — asking before
  each (non-interactive without `--yes` removes nothing). Your savings ledger is
  **kept** unless you pass `--purge`. It can't uninstall the running package
  itself, so it prints the exact uninstall command for how distil was installed
  (pipx/uv/pip). `distil default --undo` now also **stops** a running proxy service
  (launchctl/systemctl), not just deletes its definition file.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-30 — Make distil the default

### Added
- **`distil default` — make distil the default for your agent, no per-session
  `distil wrap`.** Writes a single managed (marked, backed-up, idempotent) block
  to the shell rc that distil actually detects for *this* machine — zsh (`.zshrc`),
  bash (`.bashrc`/`.bash_profile`), fish (`config.fish`), or PowerShell (`$PROFILE`)
  — using the right syntax for each (alias / function / `export` / `set -gx`). An
  explicit `$SHELL` wins over file-existence guesses, and the command **reports
  what it detected** rather than acting blind. `--always-on` installs a persistent
  proxy service (launchd / systemd) + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` so *every* SDK routes
  through distil (with an honest single-point-of-failure caveat); `--undo` removes
  whichever is installed. `distil onboard` now offers it interactively.
- **`distil onboard` is now upgrade-aware and agent-ready.** It checks PyPI
  (offline-safe) and, if a newer release exists, shows the exact upgrade command
  for your install method (pipx/uv/pip) — `--upgrade` runs it. New
  **`distil onboard --json`** emits the full environment + version status +
  recommendations as structured data so an agent can reason over it.
- **Intelligent `/distil-onboard` skill** — rather than a static installer, the
  Claude Code command now senses via `--json`, assesses *your* situation
  (upgrade, which agent, billing reality, gaps), and guides you through setup +
  validation conversationally, asking and adapting rather than ticking boxes.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-30 — One-command onboarding

### Added
- **`distil onboard`** — one command that detects your environment (OS, package
  managers, agent CLIs, install method, the `anthropic` extra, Claude Code +
  subscription), wires the savings status line, and prints a **next-steps guide
  tailored to what it found** — how to route the detected agent (subscription-safe
  vs metered), validate outcomes with shadow mode, watch savings, run the gate,
  and re-verify with `distil doctor`. `--dry-run` changes nothing. Cross-platform
  (macOS / Windows).

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-30 — Setup & diagnostics UX

Friction-killers for getting distil running and trusting it.

### Added
- **`distil doctor`** — one command diagnoses a setup end-to-end: distil/Python
  version, savings ledger (subscription-aware), shadow-validation status, an
  **in-process proxy round-trip self-test** (proves the proxy machinery works with
  no network), the optional `anthropic` extra + API key, and Claude Code
  status-line wiring + subscription detection. Exits non-zero on any failure.
- **`distil setup`** — wire the savings status line into Claude Code's
  `settings.json` in one command: idempotent, never clobbers an existing line
  without `--force` (backs it up), preserves all other settings.
- **Subscription auto-detect** — the status line and dashboard now drop the
  notional dollar figure automatically on a Claude OAuth subscription (no more
  manual `DISTIL_SUBSCRIPTION=1`; the env var still overrides).
- **Status line** shows the shadow **sample count** next to `eq%`
  (`eq 99.5% (1.2k)`) so the confidence is visible.
- **Dashboard** gains a **live recent-decisions strip** under decision-equivalence
  (▰ same next action · ▱ changed), refreshing with the panel.
- Verified **multi-provider shadow** — decision discrimination tested for
  Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini response shapes.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-30 — Hardening + live-validation UX

Post-GA hardening of the 1.0 line, validated end-to-end across every command.
Zero-dependency stdlib core; **665 tests**.

### Fixed
- **Status line `BrokenPipeError`** — on Python 3.13+, when the status-line
  consumer (e.g. Claude Code) read the line and closed the pipe, the interpreter's
  shutdown flush faulted with a traceback. The `statusline` path now flushes under
  guard and exits cleanly; verified 0/40 on the real binary.
- **Shadow-mode dropped samples** — each sampled decision ran in a daemon thread
  that was killed on proxy teardown (quick runs / last turn), so
  `distil wrap --shadow` could show 0 samples despite live traffic. In-flight
  comparison threads are now drained (bounded) on shutdown.
- **Raw tracebacks → actionable messages** — `--tokenizer/--runner anthropic`
  (missing `anthropic` extra or API key) and `distil ingest --input <bad-path>`
  now fail with a clear, single-line message instead of a Python traceback.
- **Claude Code plugin manifest** — `repository` must be a string URL (was an
  object), which blocked installation.

### Added
- **`distil dashboard`** — a live, zero-dependency terminal TUI: alternate-screen
  framed panel with Unicode bars for token-trim and decision-equivalence,
  original → compressed tokens/cost, and per-trajectory bars.
- **`distil wrap --shadow RATE`** — one-command live decision-equivalence: wraps
  the agent, starts the proxy, sets the base URL, and shadow-samples — no second
  terminal, no manual env var.
- **Status line** now shows **original → compressed** tokens and cost, surfaces
  live decision-equivalence (`eq N%`) when shadow has samples, and drops the
  notional dollar figure on flat-rate subscriptions (`DISTIL_SUBSCRIPTION=1`).
- **Plugin commands** — `/distil-stats`, `/distil-shadow`, `/distil-dashboard`
  alongside `/distil`.
- **Docs** — README and the docs site document `--shadow` outcome validation, the
  dashboard, subscription mode, and the one-command shadow flow.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-29 — General Availability

**1.0 / GA.** The compression engine, the proxy/SDK integrations, and the
decision-equivalence certificate machinery are production-grade, API-stable, and
covered by **658 tests** with a zero-dependency stdlib core. This release folds in the
cross-model, cost-frontier, and continuous-assurance work that landed after 0.28.0 and
declares a stable public surface.

**What "1.0 / GA" means (and what it doesn't).** It is a commitment to a stable API and
to the contract that protects you — *certify decision-equivalence, or fall back to full
context; never silently lossy*. It is **not** a claim that aggressive compression is safe
on every agent untuned: E7/E11 show the opposite, which is precisely why the operating
point is **auto-calibrated per deployment and fail-safe**. Honest scope, unchanged: the
guarantee is distribution-free and finite-sample, **conditional on exchangeability** with
your calibration distribution. See [`docs/GA_READINESS.md`](docs/GA_READINESS.md) for the
full ledger of what is closed and what remains empirical breadth.

### Added — cross-model generality (E11)
- **Validated across 5 models / 3 vendors.** The long-horizon harness (30-turn ReAct,
  SWE-bench Verified) now reports gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4.1 (OpenAI), Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic),
  Haiku 4.5 (Anthropic, n=500), and DeepSeek-V3 (n=200). **gate@12 shows no statistically
  significant degradation on any of the five models.** The two well-powered runs (Haiku
  n=500, DeepSeek n=200) confirm non-inferiority; the three n=50 runs are directionally
  consistent with wide CIs (honestly marked as not powered).
- **Corrected finding.** An earlier reading of DeepSeek alone ("aggressiveness must scale
  with model capability") is **refuted** by the wider sweep: harm appears only as the
  product of *realized compression × the agent's reliance on aged-out context* — a
  workload×model interaction, not raw capability. A fixed `gate_recent` cannot predict it,
  which is why you must calibrate on outcomes per deployment.
- **OpenAI 429 handling** — retry on TPM rate-limits with backoff + `Retry-After`.

### Added — auto-calibration, productionized (closes the headline GA risk)
- `distil calibrate` selects the most aggressive working-set size whose task-success loss
  is non-inferior to full context (paired McNemar), and **fails safe to full context** if
  none certifies — the operating-point analogue of the certificate. Reproduces the manual
  E11 choice automatically (selects gate@12, rejects gate@6 on DeepSeek). `distil/calibrate.py`,
  `tests/test_calibrate.py`. The relevance gate is now a shippable library primitive
  (`distil/gate.py`: `working_set_indices`, `gate_fraction`), not benchmark-only.

### Added — cost frontier under the motto (E12)
- **Cache-monotone gate** (`gate.py:monotone_gate`) — deterministic append-only digests so
  the digested prefix is byte-stable and prompt-cache/KV reuse captures it.
- **Graded gate** (`gate.py:graded_gate`) — per-distance compression tiers, certified with
  the tighter empirical-Bernstein (Maurer–Pontil) bound (`conformal.py`).
- **Speculative expansion** (`speculative.py`) and **constrained-bandit operating-point
  search** (`calibrate.py:bandit_select_operating_point`) — fail-safe, shipped + tested.
  All levers cut cost *inside* the certified envelope; they never trade the guarantee for
  dollars.

### Added — continuous assurance under drift (E13)
- **Anytime-valid drift monitor** (`drift.py:DriftMonitor`) — a betting e-process for
  `H0: risk ≤ α` (Waudby-Smith & Ramdas 2023) you may check after *every* turn with
  false-alarm probability ≤ δ regardless of how often you peek (Ville's inequality). Trips
  when live decision-change exceeds the certified budget → recalibrate or fall back.
- **Cross-family grader ensemble** (`ensemble.py:EnsembleGrader`) — conservative "any-change"
  aggregation keeps measured risk an upper bound even if one grader family is unfaithful.
- **Anytime-valid certificate** for graded losses (`conformal.py:betting_upper_bound`).

### Changed
- Package version reconciled to **1.0.0** (`pyproject.toml`, `distil/__init__.py`,
  `CITATION.cff`); PyPI classifier → **Production/Stable**.
- Docs/site test counts corrected to 658; the landing page's E11 narrative updated to the
  corrected (5-model) finding.

## [0.28.0] — 2026-06-26

E10: trajectory-level decision-equivalence certificate — the first distribution-free,
out-of-sample-proven guarantee at the whole-run level for agent context compression.

- **E10 trajectory-level certificate.** Lifts the per-turn E2 certificate to the
  full trajectory (task) level using the same Learn-Then-Test / Hoeffding–Bentkus
  engine (`distil.conformal.certified_risk_bound`), inverted to a (1−δ) upper
  confidence bound on per-trajectory 0/1 loss. Two loss functions on the full
  500-instance SWE-bench Verified set (δ=0.05):
  - **Divergence** (outcome ≠ full context): empirical 14.4%, certified ≤ **18.0%**.
  - **Harm** (full resolved the task, gated did not): empirical 8.4%, certified
    ≤ **11.4%** — about 1 in 9 solvable tasks, certified.
  - Plain-language: "With 95% confidence, the relevance-gated compressor changes
    a run's outcome on ≤18.0% of exchangeable tasks and costs a solvable task on
    ≤11.4%."
- **Out-of-sample proof.** Over 1000 random calibration/test splits, the bound β
  is certified on the calibration half and checked on the disjoint test half.
  Realized coverage: **95.4%** (divergence) and **96.7%** (harm) — both at or
  above the 95% target. The bound holds on held-out data, not merely asserted on
  training data.
- **Honest reporting: ungated reversible tier.** The ungated tier (condition D, E8)
  also certifies: divergence ≤23.2%, out-of-sample coverage 93.9% — marginally
  below the 95% target. Reported without softening.
- **Honest scope.** The guarantee is exchangeability-conditional: valid for traffic
  exchangeable with the calibration distribution (SWE-bench Verified, this agent +
  model). Changing the agent, model, or task distribution requires re-certification.
- **Why it matters.** E2 guaranteed a per-turn proxy. E7/E8 showed that proxy
  doesn't naively transfer to task success under aggressive compression. E9
  quantified the composition gap. E10 closes it: the first trajectory-level,
  distribution-free decision-equivalence certificate for agent context compression
  (to our knowledge).
- **Reproducible.** `benchmarks/trajectory_certificate.py`; numbers trace to
  `docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon/trajectory_certificate.json`.
- **Docs updated:** `docs/research.html` (E10 section with results table and OOS
  proof), `docs/index.html` (honest-scope headline line), `docs/concepts.html`
  (certificate callout).

## [0.27.0] — 2026-06-26

Final E8 long-horizon results: 6-condition frontier including Headroom
competitor, skeleton digest, sticky expansion, digest-mode-per-tier ablation,
and the E9 trajectory-composition certificate bound.

- **E8 long-horizon SWE-bench Verified — final 6-condition frontier.** A
  custom multi-turn ReAct coding agent (read / search / edit_file / run_tests,
  up to 30 turns, `claude-haiku-4-5`, temp 0) run end-to-end on the full
  500-instance SWE-bench Verified set, scored by the official `swebench`
  harness (hidden tests, per-instance Docker). Runs average ~27 turns. Six
  conditions, same agent, compressor differs (ordered by pass@1, Wilson 95%
  CI, resolved/500):
  - **A (full context):** 196/500 — 39.2% [35.0, 43.5]
  - **E (distil reversible, relevance-gated):** 184/500 — **36.8%** [32.7, 41.1]
  - **F (Headroom, lossy competitor):** 163/500 — 32.6% [28.6, 36.8]
  - **D (distil reversible + skeleton digest, ungated):** 162/500 — 32.4% [28.4, 36.6]
  - **B (distil `trunc@500`, aggressive lossy):** 28/500 — 5.6% [3.9, 8.0]
  - **C (LLMLingua-2, lossy competitor):** 12/500 — 2.4% [1.4, 4.2]
  - Total API spend across all six conditions: $571.15
- **Key results (paired McNemar, same 500 instances).**
  - Gate (E) vs full context (A): −2.4 pp, 95% CI [−5.7, +0.9], McNemar
    p=0.19. Non-inferior at a 6 pp margin (borderline at strict 5 pp). This
    is a non-inferiority result, not equivalence. The gate is the **only
    condition statistically non-inferior to full context**.
  - Gate (E) vs Headroom (F): +4.2 pp, McNemar p=0.035. Statistically
    significant. Distil is not cheapest — Headroom is cheaper — but beats
    Headroom on task success with significance.
  - Gate (E) vs LLMLingua-2 (C): 174 gate wins vs 2 LLMLingua-2 wins,
    McNemar p<0.001. E and C remove nearly identical context fractions (53%
    vs 52%), isolating *what* is kept as the deciding factor.
  - Lossy truncation (B) vs full: p<0.001.
- **Honest headline.** On the axis that defines the field — certified
  decision-equivalence plus real task success — distil leads. It does **not**
  claim cost-domination. Headroom is cheaper. The claim is: the only certified
  and reversible compressor, with the highest task-success of any compressor
  tested, and the only one statistically non-inferior to full context.
- **New technique: content-aware skeleton digest** (`distil/compress/skeleton.py`).
  For the active-recovery (ungated) tier, large source files are digested to a
  navigable skeleton: every `import`/`class`/`def` signature retained, traceback
  tails kept, bodies elided. Deterministic and stdlib-only (no model, no network
  — auditable and secure). Byte-exact reversible via content handle. Lifted
  ungated pass@1 from 28.8% to 32.4% (condition D).
- **New technique: sticky expansion** (`distil/expand.py`). Once the agent
  recovers a block via `distil_expand`, that block stays full for the rest of
  the session (handles are deterministic). Eliminates re-expansion thrash on
  repeatedly-accessed files. Never-regressing by construction.
- **Honest ablation: digest mode per tier.** Applying the skeleton digest to
  the *relevance-gated* (passive) tier regressed pass@1 from 36.8% to 5.6%,
  matching lossy truncation. A navigable digest makes the agent over-trust the
  summary and stop re-reading. Skeleton digest is correct for the
  active-recovery tier; head-truncation is correct for the passive tier. This
  finding is published as-is.
- **E9 trajectory-composition certificate bound.** The per-turn certificate
  extends to multi-turn trajectories. Across ~27-turn runs, only ~1.8 turns are
  outcome-determining, so the naive composition bound (which becomes vacuous at
  ~27 turns) overstates risk. The formal per-trajectory bound remains an open
  problem; reversibility is the operative safety guarantee for the
  active-recovery tier.
- **Docs updated:** `docs/research.html` (6-condition table, Headroom row,
  skeleton/sticky sections, honest-ablation note, certificate scope), plus
  `docs/index.html`, `docs/concepts.html`, `docs/benchmark.html`,
  `docs/techniques.html` (skeleton digest and sticky expansion sections).
- Numbers trace to
  `docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon/swe_bench_verified_longhorizon.json`.

## [0.25.1] — 2026-06-25

Version bump only; same content as the v0.25.0 release notes — fixes the PyPI
publish that failed on a duplicate filename in v0.25.0 (the package version was
still `0.24.0`, so the wheel/sdist collided with an already-uploaded
distribution). The v0.25.0 tag and GitHub Release are intentionally left in
place. See the [v0.25.0 release](https://github.com/dshakes/distil/releases/tag/v0.25.0)
for the substantive change (Phase 5 / E7 SWE-bench Verified end-to-end eval).

## [0.24.0] — Ecosystem hooks + on-motto gap-closing

New surface area for agent frameworks and observability — every addition kept
under the decision-equivalence certificate, with the platform scope-creep
deliberately declined.

- **LangGraph hook** (`distil/integrations/langgraph.py`) — a drop-in
  `pre_model_hook()` that compresses graph state right before the model node, plus
  a `compress_state()` helper for manual use inside any node. Duck-typed (never
  imports langgraph/langchain); returns only the updated message list so every
  other state field is untouched. Joins the existing LiteLLM + LangChain hooks.
  Example: `examples/python_langgraph.py`.
- **Cache-prefix observability** — the proxy now emits
  `x-distil-cache-prefix-msgs: <n>` under `--session-delta`, exposing exactly how
  many leading messages stayed byte-identical vs the previous turn (the
  prompt-cache-read region). The verifiable benefit of a prefix-freeze router,
  content-free — distil is cache-monotonic by construction, so the prefix is real,
  not rewritten.
- **Pluggable salience scorer seam** — `salient_tokens(..., scorer=…)` accepts an
  optional callable (a semantic / NER / embedding model) whose spans are unioned
  into the model-free signals. Off by default (runtime stays model-free,
  zero-dep); a bad scorer can never break compression (guarded), and whatever it
  returns is still judged by the same certificate — the seam adds *coverage*,
  never an unverified guarantee.
- **Docs:** README now documents the framework hooks and a "Deliberately *not* a
  platform" section — why memory/knowledge-graph, hosted semantic cache, and
  editor-auth are out of scope (they can't be put under the certificate), and what
  we adopted instead because it survives the gate.

## [0.23.2] — Mobile docs, animated architecture diagram, distribution fix

- **Fixed a broken Homebrew distribution.** Both formulas (repo + tap) had frozen
  their `url`/`version` at v0.21.0 while the `sha256` advanced — so `brew install`
  failed on a sha mismatch. Root cause (a version-specific regex in the update step)
  fixed with a version-agnostic pattern; both formulas now consistent at the current
  release and verified against the published tarball.
- **Mobile-responsive docs.** Wide benchmark tables now scroll horizontally instead
  of overflowing; landing stats collapse to one column, CTAs stack, padding/typography
  scale down — across the docs site and the landing page.
- **New animated architecture diagram** (`docs/assets/architecture.svg`) — a realistic
  depiction of the pipeline (agent → compress/cache-pin/forward → provider), the
  transparent recovery loop, and the quality-contract band (certificate · shadow ·
  flywheel), with flowing-data animation. Shown on README, Concepts, Architecture.
- **Vocabulary consistency:** `distil bench` now reports savings as "reversibly"
  (the strategy uses the Tier-1 reversible digest), matching the v0.23.1 terminology.

## [0.23.1] — Honest vocabulary: "reversible" vs "lossless"

A precision pass on terminology so no claim can be read as an overclaim:
- **The default Tier-1 digest is now described as "reversible"** (byte-recoverable on
  demand), not "lossless". "Lossless" is reserved for the **byte-in-context** tier
  (Tier-0 / `--verbatim`), where the model sees content unchanged. "Lossy" stays for
  the irrecoverable competitors. All three Distil tiers remain certified
  decision-equivalent. Updated the README headline + prose, the benchmark method
  label, and added an explicit three-tier definition to the README and Concepts page.
- **`--safe`** added as a clearer alias for **`--lossless-only`** (the
  policy/subscription-safe mode: no lossy shaping, no tool injection — the reversible
  digest still runs); `--verbatim` remains the byte-in-context switch. Internal
  strategy/ladder identifiers are unchanged (no behavior change).

## [0.23.0] — GA polish: grounded docs, genuine head-to-head, recipes

A go-live pass: every customer-facing claim audited against code, every benchmark
number re-measured genuinely, and the docs made white-glove.

- **Genuine, apples-to-apples benchmarks.** Fixed the local competitor adapters so
  they actually engage: Headroom is now driven its real whole-conversation way
  (`optimize=True`) instead of no-op'ing on a per-block user message; LLMLingua-2 is
  applied to every tool result and memoised (pure function). Corrected the v0.22.0
  coding-agent competitor numbers (which were harness artifacts) to the real ones —
  **LLMLingua-2 56.8% tok / 57.2% $ / 274 ms / lossy**, **Headroom 22.4% tok /
  −16.8% $ (busts the prompt cache by default) / 5.3 ms / lossy**. distil leads on
  cache-aware dollars (91.1%) and is the only reversible method.
- **Docs claims audit (no fake, all real grounded).** Removed fabricated claims (a
  non-existent "proxy detects subscription keys" path; `ingest --format` auto-detect;
  `output-savings --mode/--runner` flags; invented `corpus.validate()` invariants),
  corrected CLI flag tables, fixed `compress_messages(verbatim=)` signature, the
  salience module path, and the 8 proxy response headers; clarified that the live
  83.2%/53.1%/35.3% run needs an API key and is not offline-reproducible.
- **Diagrams** (YC-style, on-brand): `cache-delta.svg` and `ast-delta.svg`, embedded
  in the techniques and benchmark pages.
- **White-glove "Use it on your workflow" recipes** in the README — coding and
  non-coding use cases, a see-it/prove-it table, and a config rule-of-thumb.

## [0.22.0] — Coding-agent benchmark + two correctness fixes it found

Building the messages-level coding-agent benchmark (`benchmarks/codebench.py`:
read→edit→reread sessions, cache-aware dollars vs the real headroom + llmlingua
packages) surfaced two real bugs, both now fixed:

- **Cache-delta is now cache-monotonic by construction.** `cachedelta.delta_encode`
  was rewritten as a *pure per-call walk* over the cumulative messages (message *i*
  is deduped only against messages 0..i-1). Previously the stable prefix was passed
  through as originals while the prior turn had emitted those messages as markers, so
  a re-read flipped marker→original on entering the prefix and **busted the prompt
  cache**. The pure-walk encoding emits identical bytes for the cached prefix every
  turn. (`session` is now optional — the cumulative conversation is the memory.)
- **Tier-0 never inflates tokens.** `collapse_runs` could turn a run of near-free
  blank lines into a `<<x N>>` marker that costs *more* tokens; the adapter had only
  a char-based guard. `_apply_tier0` now keeps the collapse only when it reduces the
  **token** count. (Fixes verbatim mode showing negative savings on whitespace-heavy
  content.)
- Net effect on the coding benchmark: verbatim+cache-delta went from −1.4% to a real
  **+43.8% cache-aware savings (reversible)**; plain verbatim from −3.5% to 0.0%.
  The PAYG digest remains the dominant lever (~91%). 3 regression tests (498 total).

## [0.21.0] — Edit-equivalence (decision-equivalence, made precise for code)

- **Edit-equivalence**: the decision signature now AST-normalizes code-bearing tool
  inputs (e.g. an `Edit`/`Write` `new_str`). For coding agents the decision *is* the
  edit, so two responses that make the agent write the same code with trivially
  different whitespace or comments now count as **equivalent**, while a real logic
  change still differs. This stops shadow-mode over-reporting drift and lets the
  certificate claim safe savings it previously, conservatively, could not.
- Implemented model-free with the stdlib `ast` (`_normalize_decision` → `ast.dump`),
  applied through shared signature builders so the JSON, streamed (SSE), and
  chunk-array paths all stay consistent. Non-code strings and non-Python pass
  through untouched. 5 tests (495 total). ruff clean, verify + bench PASS.

## [0.20.0] — AST-structural delta (the deepest cache-delta layer)

- **AST-structural delta** (`astdelta.py`, stdlib `ast`, model-free): for Python,
  cross-version delta now diffs by *parsed structure*. Each top-level definition is
  fingerprinted with `ast.dump` (attributes off) — invariant to whitespace,
  comments, and import order. A reformat-only re-read is recognised as "no
  definition changed" and referenced; only definitions whose AST actually changed
  are sent in full. Textual diff explodes on reformatting; the structural delta
  isolates exactly what changed.
- Wired as the preferred near-duplicate path in `cachedelta.py` (the `--session-delta`
  feature); non-Python or unparseable (mid-edit) source falls back to the textual
  unified diff, so it never fails a request. Decision-equivalent (unchanged defs are
  still in cached context) and reversible (`distil_expand` recovers the full file).
- 8 tests. Full suite 490 passed, ruff clean, verify + bench PASS.

## [0.19.0] — Cache-delta context coding (cross-version delta)

The coding-agent moat. The hot path is read → edit → **re-read**, and the re-read
file is a *near-duplicate* (one hunk changed), so exact-duplicate dedup misses it
and re-sends the whole file. Cache-delta coding (`cachedelta.py`,
`distil proxy --session-delta`, opt-in) sends only the diff:

- **Cross-version delta** — a re-read-after-edit is replaced by a reference to the
  prior version + a unified diff of what changed; exact re-sends become a compact
  back-reference. Both confined to the **volatile suffix** — the stable cached
  prefix is never mutated (*cache-monotonicity*), so prompt-cache hits survive.
- **Decision-equivalent + reversible**: prior-version (still in cached context) +
  diff carries the same information for the next action; the full current version is
  kept locally and recovered byte-exact via `distil_expand`. Shadow mode measures it.
- Wired into `distil proxy` / `distil wrap` (messages format) behind `--session-delta`;
  emits `x-distil-cache-refs` / `-delta` / `-tokens-saved` headers. End-to-end a
  re-read-after-edit saved ~85% of the re-read (902 of 1063 tokens) vs re-sending whole.
- 10 tests. Full suite 482 passed, ruff clean, verify + bench PASS.

## [0.18.0] — Streaming-aware shadow mode (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini)

- **Shadow-mode now works on streaming sessions.** Real agent sessions (Claude Code,
  Codex, the Gemini CLI) stream their responses over SSE, which the previous shadow
  comparison couldn't parse — so it silently recorded nothing. `shadow.py` now
  reconstructs the decision from a streamed body: `decision_signature_from_body`
  reads a non-streaming JSON body directly and rebuilds a streamed (SSE or
  chunk-array) one via `_decision_from_chunks`, accumulating the first tool call
  across chunks for all three providers (Anthropic `input_json_delta`, OpenAI
  `tool_calls` argument deltas, Gemini `functionCall`). A streamed response yields
  the same signature as its non-streamed equivalent, so comparisons are valid.
- The proxy shadow path now compares raw bodies via `decision_signature_from_body`,
  so `distil proxy --shadow` measures live decision-equivalence on streaming traffic.
  Verified end-to-end on an SSE tool-call response.

## [0.17.0] — Decouple compression aggression from auth (`--verbatim`)

Resolves an overload introduced in 0.16.0. `--lossless-only` had been redefined to
mean "Tier-0 only," which **contradicted `policy.py`** (where the reversible digest
*is* the lossless strategy that subscription sessions use) and silently de-tuned
autonomous agents on subscription/OAuth from ~70%+ down to ~10%.

- **`--lossless-only` restored** to its policy meaning: lossless *strategies* only
  (no lossy output-shaping) + no tool injection. The reversible, certificate-backed
  Tier-1 digest **still runs** — consistent with `policy.py` and the project's
  definition of "lossless" (reversible + decision-equivalent).
- **New `--verbatim` flag** (proxy / `wrap` / gateway): skips the Tier-1 digest
  entirely (Tier-0 only) so the model sees content un-stubbed. The right mode for
  interactive (human-in-the-loop) sessions or out-of-distribution traffic. Lower
  savings, byte-in-context fidelity.
- Adapter/integration kwargs renamed to match: `compress_messages(..., verbatim=)`,
  `compress_generate_request(..., verbatim=)`; LiteLLM `distil_verbatim`; LangChain
  `compress_messages(..., verbatim=)`. Docs reconciled across CLI / adapters /
  integrations / faq / deploy-security.

## [0.16.0] — Ecosystem hooks: MCP server + LiteLLM/LangChain

- **MCP server** (`mcp_server.py`, `distil mcp`): a zero-dependency, stdlib-only
  Model Context Protocol server over stdio JSON-RPC 2.0. Exposes `distil_compress`
  (reversible digest + handle, original kept in a local on-disk store),
  `distil_expand` (recover by handle), and `distil_savings`. Wire it into any MCP
  client (Claude Desktop, IDEs, agents). The message handler is a pure function and
  is unit-tested without real stdio; the loop is verified end-to-end.
- **In-process framework hooks** (`integrations/`): LiteLLM (`compress`/`completion`/
  `acompletion`) and LangChain (`compress_messages`, duck-typed over message objects
  *and* dicts) compress requests before they leave the process — same reversible
  compression as the proxy, no sidecar required. Both lazy-import their framework, so
  distil stays zero-runtime-deps.

## [0.15.0] — Claude Code plugin + status line

- **`distil statusline`** (new CLI command): renders a compact one-line savings
  summary from the local ledger (tokens, dollars, runs, and live decision-
  equivalence when shadow-mode has samples). Reads the optional Claude Code status-
  line JSON on stdin for the model name; never raises.
- **Claude Code plugin** (`plugins/distil/` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`):
  installable via `/plugin marketplace add dshakes/distil`. Ships a `/distil`
  command (savings report + setup help) and a `statusline.sh` that calls
  `distil statusline`. Honest scope: a plugin cannot reroute a running session or
  set the main status line from its manifest, so the README documents the one-line
  `settings.json` addition; traffic is compressed via `distil wrap` / `distil proxy`.

## [0.14.0] — Google Gemini adapter + true lossless-only

- **Gemini adapter** (`adapters/gemini.py`): the proxy, async proxy, and gateway now
  compress Google's `generateContent` request shape (`contents` / `parts` /
  `functionResponse`) — a third first-class provider alongside Anthropic and the
  OpenAI-compatible family. `text` parts get Tier-0 lossless transforms; large
  `functionResponse` string values get the Tier-1 *reversible* digest (recoverable
  via the local store); `functionCall`, `inlineData`, `fileData`, and model-authored
  text pass through untouched. Path-detected (`:generateContent` /
  `:streamGenerateContent`), so just `--upstream https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`.
  Shadow-mode live decision-equivalence works for Gemini too. (Expand-tool injection,
  output shaping, and Gemini context caching remain messages-format-only for now.)
- **`--lossless-only` is now genuinely lossless-in-context** (GA correctness fix). It
  previously still applied the Tier-1 digest, replacing tool output the model could not
  recover (tool injection is disallowed on subscription/OAuth) with a stub — despite
  the "safe for subscription" label. It now applies only Tier-0 transforms in this
  mode, so the model sees semantically identical content. The aggressive,
  certificate-backed reversible digest remains the default (PAYG) behavior.

## [0.13.0] — Shadow-mode live decision-equivalence

- **Shadow mode** (`shadow.py`, `distil proxy --shadow RATE`, `distil shadow-stats`):
  samples a fraction of live requests, runs each one **both compressed and
  uncompressed** in a background thread (never blocking the client), and records a
  **content-free live decision-change rate** on real traffic. The continuous online
  counterpart to the offline certificate — decision-equivalence becomes observable
  in production. Decision = the agent's next `tool_use`/`tool_call`; equivalence
  iff that action matches.
- README: a "See it working — real-time savings & live equivalence" section
  (per-request headers, gateway dashboard, genuine-savings ledger, shadow mode,
  and one-env-var org-wide enforcement).

## [0.12.1] — GA hardening

Pre-GA security + correctness pass (no behavior change to the happy path):

- **Request-path safety** (`httpguard.py`, applied across `proxy`, `aproxy`, `gateway`):
  upstream-path validation (blocks `@`/`//`/`..` host-injection SSRF), defensive
  `Content-Length` parsing, an 8 MiB body cap, and a bounded async connector.
- **Crash-resistance**: `compress_messages` and `ingest` no longer raise on
  malformed-but-valid JSON (missing/non-string `text`, non-dict messages, bad
  JSONL lines) — they pass such input through untouched; the compress call in
  every proxy is additionally guarded so compression can never break a request.
- **Gateway**: tenant labels are sanitized to a safe charset (no injection into
  accounting or the dashboard) and all HTML renderers (`gateway`, `telemetry`,
  `ledger`) escape interpolated values (stored-XSS fix).
- **Correctness**: `salience.protect()` now falls back to the byte-exact original
  (never the stripped block) so a salient line is never silently dropped, and uses
  exact line membership; `structured.fold` leaves null-bearing records byte-exact
  (no null-vs-missing ambiguity); the Rust hot-path pins JSON key order to match
  the Python backend.

## [0.12.0]

The Decision-Equivalence Risk Certificate (conformal risk control, `distil conformal`),
salience protection (model-free frontier shifter), and the live head-to-head vs. the
real LLMLingua-2 / Headroom packages. See `BENCHMARKS.md`.

## [0.9.0 – 0.11.0]
