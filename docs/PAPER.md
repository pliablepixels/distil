## Abstract

LLM agents resend a growing context every turn, so context size dominates serving
cost. Existing context compressors report token savings but offer **no guarantee
that the agent still behaves the same**. We reframe the objective from byte- or
embedding-fidelity to **decision-equivalence**: a compression is acceptable iff the
agent takes the same next action it would have on the uncompressed context. We then
give this a **distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee** by casting level selection
as conformal risk control (Learn-Then-Test / Conformal Risk Control) with the loss
defined as a decision flip. The certificate states, for a chosen risk budget α and
confidence 1−δ, that the decision-change rate on exchangeable traffic is ≤ α. We
evaluate on **real τ-bench agent trajectories** and the full **SWE-bench_Lite
(300 instances)** edit-localization, graded by a real model with no answer-revealing
markers using majority-of-3 structured (forced-tool) grading. We validate the guarantee
**out-of-sample**: across 500 calibration/test splits on real SWE traces the empirical
coverage is **96–100% at the claimed 95% confidence**, with realized decision-change rate
conservatively below the budget (8.0% at α=15%, 11.7% at α=20%). The certificate yields a
real operating point — **15.7% certified token savings at α=15%** (22.9% at α=20%) — and
at strict budgets correctly declines to overclaim. On the same real traces the reversible
**digest + recover-on-demand** tier flips fewer decisions than equally-aggressive lossy
compression (10.2% vs. 11.5% at ≈22% savings; sharper on smaller samples, 11.2%→7.5%),
while on already-compact contexts (τ-bench) the certificate correctly declines to certify
savings — quantifying *where* recoverable compression helps rather than overclaiming a
single headline ratio.

## 1. Introduction

- Agent serving cost scales with re-sent context; prompt caching shifts the cost to
  cache *misses*, which compression of the volatile tail can reduce.
- The gap: every shipping compressor quotes a savings *estimate*; none certifies that
  the agent’s *decisions* are unchanged. "100% accuracy" is a slogan, not a number.
- Contributions:
  1. **Decision-equivalence** as the compression objective (loss = the agent’s next
     action flips vs. uncompressed).
  2. A **decision-equivalence risk certificate**: conformal risk control (LTT/CRC)
     selecting the most aggressive level whose decision-change rate is provably ≤ α.
     To our knowledge, conformal control with an *agent-decision* loss for context
     compression is unstudied (the nearest work applies conformal guarantees to RAG
     retrieval recall — a different task).
  3. A **cache-aware, reversible** compression engine (digest-behind-handle +
     recover-on-demand) that operates inside the certified frontier.
  4. An **evaluation on real agent traces** that removes the circular self-labeling
     of synthetic corpora, with the guarantee **validated out-of-sample** and under
     **distribution shift**.

## 2. Related work

- Context/prompt compression: LLMLingua / LLMLingua-2 / LongLLMLingua, RECOMP,
  selective-context, soft-prompt distillation. All optimize a fidelity/relevance
  proxy; none certifies decision-equivalence.
- Prompt caching and cache-aware serving.
- Distribution-free uncertainty: conformal prediction; **Learn-Then-Test**
  (Angelopoulos et al., 2021/2025) and **Conformal Risk Control** (Angelopoulos et
  al., ICLR 2024). Closest application: conformal guarantees for RAG recall
  (ECIR 2026) — retrieval, not agent-decision-preserving compression.

## 3. Problem formulation

- A trajectory is a sequence of turns; each turn is the full context the agent saw,
  decomposed into typed blocks with a stability hint (cacheable prefix vs. volatile
  tail). A *decision* is the agent’s next action — a tool call (τ-bench) or an
  edit/command (SWE-bench) — represented as a canonical `{action, target}`
  fingerprint produced by a grading model from context alone (no directive/marker).
- Loss on a (turn, level): `L = 1` iff the decision under the compressed context
  differs from the decision under the uncompressed context. `R(λ)` is the expected
  loss (decision-change rate) at compression level λ.
- A compression **ladder** orders levels least→most aggressive: byte-exact →
  reversible lossless digest → salience-protected truncation → raw truncation sweep.

## 4. Method

### 4.1 Cache-aware reversible engine
- Keep the prefix byte-stable (schema canonicalization; lift volatile fields), digest
  only the volatile tail behind a content handle, keep the original locally, expose a
  recover-on-demand tool. Lossless = byte-in-context; reversible = digested but
  byte-recoverable; lossy = the rest. (Details in repo `compress/`.)

### 4.2 Causal pruning (discovery)
- Ablate a block, replay, keep iff a decision changes — yields a causally-justified
  pruning policy rather than a heuristic.

### 4.3 The decision-equivalence risk certificate
- Calibrate per-turn losses for each ladder level on held-out-of-test calibration
  traffic. Select with **LTT** (Hoeffding–Bentkus p-values, fixed-sequence testing):
  guarantees `P(R(λ̂) ≤ α) ≥ 1−δ`; or **CRC** for the monotone 0/1 loss:
  `E[L(λ̂)] ≤ α`. Operating point = highest-savings level in the certified prefix.
- The exchangeability assumption is explicit; the guarantee is marginal over the
  calibration distribution, recalibrated under drift.

## 5. Experimental setup

- **Data.** Real **τ-bench** trajectories (airline/retail; gpt-4o and Sonnet-3.5
  runs; 182 trajectories / 1164 decision points after parsing the airline-gpt-4o
  log) loaded with no planted markers; the decision is the agent’s actual tool call.
  **SWE-bench** edit-localization trajectories built from real issues + gold patches
  (target file inferred from the issue amid distractors).
- **Grader.** A real model returns the `{action, target}` fingerprint via majority-of-k.
  We report **model↔gold next-action agreement** on the uncompressed context as a
  grader-faithfulness gate. Runs use `--runner claude-cli` (subscription) / `openai`
  (local open model) / `anthropic`.
- **Protocol.** E1 frontier; **E2 certification coverage** (certify on calibration,
  measure realized risk on a disjoint held-out split, over many trajectory-level
  splits → empirical `P(realized ≤ α)`); E3 leave-one-domain-out shift; **E4
  downstream task success** (trajectory keeps its outcome iff every decision is
  unchanged), vs. the uncompressed baseline with a bootstrap CI; **E5 head-to-head**
  vs. competitor/structural baselines (LLMLingua-2, LongLLMLingua, RECOMP-style
  extractive, selective-context, truncation, recency-window, keep-last-k-turns agent
  memory) under the same grader, each marked
  with whether its decision-change rate certifies ≤ α.

### 6.0 Real measured frontier (E1) — committed runs

**τ-bench airline** (gpt-4o traces, gpt-4o grader, structured, +expand; 25 traj / 105
decisions; grader↔gold agreement 48.6%):

| level | savings | decision-change |
|---|--:|--:|
| byte-exact | 0.0% | **0.0%** |
| lossless (reversible **+recovery**) | 1.0% | 29.5% |
| truncate@250 (lossy) | 9.4% | 58.1% |
| truncate@120 (lossy) | 11.0% | 64.8% |

**SWE-bench localization** — full **SWE-bench_Lite (300 instances / 600 decisions)**;
Claude grader, structured, majority-of-3, **+expand**; grader↔gold agreement 47.8%:

| level | savings | decision-change | on-changed (effective) | trivial |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| byte-exact | 0.0% | **0.0%** | 0.0% | 94% |
| lossless (reversible **+recovery**) | 21.7% | **10.2%** | 20.1% | 49% |
| truncate@250 (lossy) | 20.4% | 11.5% | 23.0% | 50% |
| truncate@120 (lossy) | 22.8% | 11.7% | 23.3% | 50% |

At equal ≈22% savings the reversible+recovery tier flips fewer decisions (10.2%) than
lossy truncation (11.5–11.7%). On a 40-trajectory subset the recovery loop's effect is
sharper (digest 11.2%→**7.5%** with `--expand`); at full scale the gap narrows but
holds. byte-exact reads a clean 0.0% (no grader-noise floor).

Three findings, all on real data:
1. **byte-exact reads a clean 0.0%** under the structured majority-vote grader — the
   measurement has no grader-noise floor (validating the protocol; cf. §6.1's broken run).
2. **Recovery helps and is necessary for the reversible tier:** on SWE the digest's
   decision-change drops 11.2%→**7.5%** with `--expand`, and at equal ~24% savings the
   reversible+recovery tier beats lossy truncation (12.5%). On τ-bench the data is
   already compact (lossless saves only 1%), so there is little to recover and aggressive
   levels flip heavily — distil's value is on **verbose** contexts, which the certificate
   correctly reflects by refusing to certify savings on compact data.
3. The honest denominator: 50–90% of turns are *trivially incompressible* (left
   byte-identical); the harness now reports both the overall and the **on-changed**
   (effective) rate so equivalence cannot be inflated by no-op turns.

### 6.0.1 The certificate holds out-of-sample (E2) — the proof

On the **full SWE-bench_Lite (300 instances, +expand)**, certifying on a calibration
split and measuring the **realized** decision-change on a disjoint held-out split, over
**500** random trajectory-level splits (δ=0.05):

| risk budget α | empirical coverage P(realized ≤ α) | mean realized risk | certified savings |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| 0.10 | **99.8%** (≥ 95% ✓) | 0.03% | ~0%* |
| 0.125 | **96.6%** (✓) | 1.02% | 1.7% |
| 0.15 | **98.8%** (✓) | 8.03% | **15.7%** |
| 0.20 | **100%** (✓) | 11.70% | **22.9%** |

\* The reversible+recovery digest's true decision-change is 10.2%, *just above* the
α=10% budget, so at α=10% the certificate conservatively certifies only the byte-exact
level (≈0 savings) — the guarantee declining to overclaim by a 0.2-point margin. As the
risk budget loosens, the certified savings rises to **15.7% at α=15%** and **22.9% at
α=20%**, and the coverage guarantee **holds out-of-sample throughout** with realized risk
conservatively below the budget (8.0% at α=15%, 11.7% at α=20%). This is a real
certified-savings operating point on real agent traces, with the honest α-vs-savings
tradeoff made explicit rather than cherry-picked.

This is the headline statistical result: **a distribution-free decision-equivalence
certificate whose finite-sample coverage holds on real agent traces.**

### 6.0.2 Head-to-head vs. baselines (E5) — same grader, with an honest confound

On a 100-trajectory SWE subset, all methods graded identically (α=0.15; the
`certifies?` column is the *single-shot* Hoeffding–Bentkus test over the full data —
weaker than the split-calibrated E2 above, and labelled as such):

| method | kind | savings | decision-change | single-shot certifies? |
|---|---|--:|--:|:--:|
| distil lossless (reversible+recovery) | distil | **21.8%** | 12.0% | ✘ |
| distil truncate@250 | distil | 20.5% | 12.0% | ✘ |
| recomp-extractive (model-free) | baseline | 18.5% | 14.0% | ✘ |
| recency-window | baseline | 16.1% | 5.5% | ✔ |
| truncate-head | baseline | 15.5% | 8.5% | ✔ |
| selective-context (model-free) | baseline | 14.8% | 6.5% | ✔ |
| keep-last-3-turns | baseline | 0.0% | 0.0% | ✔ |
| byte-exact | distil | 0.0% | 0.0% | ✔ |

The reversible+recovery tier reaches the **highest savings** (21.8%); the lossy methods
that single-shot-certify at α=15% do so only at **lower savings** (≤16%) and cannot
recover dropped detail. **Honest confound:** in our SWE *edit-localization* construction
the gold target hunk is appended **last** in the code-search observation, so
recency/tail-truncation baselines benefit from *needle position*, not content
understanding — which inflates their standing on this particular task. A content-placed
needle (or a non-localization task) would remove that advantage. We therefore treat E5 as
a frontier illustration, not a dominance claim, and rest the contribution on E2 (the
certificate's validity) and the reversible mechanism. (The real LLMLingua-2 / LongLLMLingua
packages are wired in `benchmarks/baselines.py` but require a GPU environment; they were
not run on this CPU host.)

### 6.0.3 End-to-end task-success (E7) — the certificate does **not** transfer to execution

E1–E6 measure *decision-equivalence*, a proxy. E7 is the first non-proxy test: a real
agent (**aider 0.86.2 + `claude-sonnet-4-6`**, temp 0, diff edit format) run **end-to-end**
on **SWE-bench Verified** (50 instances, seed 1729) and scored by the **official
`swebench` 4.1.0 harness**, across three conditions that share the identical agent and
differ only in how the agent's *read context* (file contents + tool output, never the
problem statement) is compressed in flight.

| condition | ctx reduction | pass@1 | 95% CI (Wilson) | resolved | cost |
|---|--:|--:|---|--:|--:|
| **A. full context** | — | **52.0%** | [38.5%, 65.2%] | 26/50 | $17.63 |
| **B. distil `trunc@500`** (aggressive **lossy**) | 86% | **16.0%** | [8.3%, 28.5%] | 8/50 | $4.00 |
| **C. LLMLingua-2** (**lossy**) | 48% | **26.0%** | [15.9%, 39.6%] | 13/50 | $12.03 |
| **D. distil reversible + `distil_expand`** | 81%* | **56.0%** | [42.3%, 68.8%] | 28/50 | $16.38 |
| **E. distil reversible, relevance-gated** | 0%** | **54.0%** | [40.4%, 67.0%] | 27/50 | $17.27 |

Paired exact McNemar (same 50 instances): **B vs. full `p<0.001`** (20 lost, 2 gained),
**C vs. full `p=0.002`**, **C vs. B `p=0.18`** (n.s.), **D vs. full `p=0.69`** (n.s. —
*statistically equal to full*), **D vs. B `p<0.001`** (D recovers 22 instances B failed).
\*For D, 81% is the *pre-recovery* digest view; the realised cost is $16.38 vs. $17.63 for
full (~7% cheaper) after the model's `distil_expand` calls. \*\*For E (gate = keep last 6
user/tool messages full, digest older periphery), these SWE conversations are ≤6 turns so
the gate is a **no-op** — only 1 block digested across all 50 instances, hence ~0 context
reduction and full-vs-gated McNemar `p=1.0` (statistically identical to full). The gate is
designed for long-horizon agents with large peripheral context; this focused localization
workload does not exercise it (tunable via `DISTIL_E7_GATE_RECENT`). **E8 (§6.0.4) runs
exactly that workload.**

**Findings, reported without cherry-picking.** (1) Both **lossy** conditions (B, C)
**significantly** collapse pass@1 vs. full — aggressive lossy compression does **not**
survive real execution. (2) The **localization certificate does not transfer**:
`trunc@500` was *certified* at 4.0% decision-change (E6) yet collapses end-to-end success
by 36 points; a decision-equivalence guarantee on a single-turn proxy is **not** a
task-success guarantee once lossy compression is aggressive. (3) **But distil's reversible
tier (D) survives execution** — digest + recover-on-demand is end-to-end **task-equivalent
to full context** (56.0% vs. 52.0%, McNemar `p=0.69`) and decisively beats the lossy
conditions, because the agent pulls back the byte-exact content it edits (every instance
expanded; 135 recoveries total). (4) The honest catch: D's *realised* coding savings are
**modest (~7%)** — the agent expands most of what it edits — so the win is *task-success
parity at a modest discount*, not the proxy headline ratios. **Keep compression
recoverable.** Per-instance breakdown: `benchmarks/swe_bench_e2e/` and
`docs/paper/results/swe_bench_verified_e2e.json`. Total API spend: $50.04.

### 6.0.4 Long-horizon agent task-success (E8) — the gate's proper test

E7's relevance-gate (condition E) was a no-op because aider's localization runs are ≤6
turns: nothing ages out of the working set, so there is no periphery to digest. **E8 is
the workload the gate was designed for.** We built a multi-turn **ReAct** coding agent
(read/search/`edit_file`/`run_tests` tools, up to 30 turns) and ran it on the **full
500-instance SWE-bench Verified** set (seed 1729), scored by the same **official `swebench`
4.1.0 harness**. Runs are genuinely long-horizon (**mean ≈27 turns**), so read-file and
tool outputs accumulate into a large peripheral context behind a small active working set.
To keep a 500-instance six-condition sweep affordable we use **`claude-haiku-4-5`** at
temp 0; conditions differ only in the compressor, so the comparison is internally valid
regardless of base model. Condition F is **Headroom**, the strongest structure-aware lossy
competitor.

| condition | pass@1 | 95% CI (Wilson) | resolved | reversible | certified |
|---|--:|---|--:|:--:|:--:|
| **A. full context** | **39.2%** | [35.0%, 43.5%] | 196/500 | — | — |
| **E. distil relevance-gated** (reversible) | **36.8%** | [32.7%, 41.1%] | 184/500 | ✓ | ✓ |
| **F. Headroom** (lossy competitor) | 32.6% | [28.6%, 36.8%] | 163/500 | ✗ | ✗ |
| **D. distil reversible + `distil_expand`** (skeleton) | 32.4% | [28.4%, 36.6%] | 162/500 | ✓ | ✓ |
| **B. distil `trunc@500`** (lossy) | 5.6% | [3.9%, 8.0%] | 28/500 | ✗ | — |
| **C. LLMLingua-2** (lossy) | 2.4% | [1.4%, 4.2%] | 12/500 | ✗ | ✗ |

Paired exact McNemar (same 500 instances): **E vs. full `p=0.19`** (42 lost, 30 gained),
**E vs. Headroom `p=0.035`** (the gate beats the strongest competitor, +4.2 pp), **F (Headroom)
vs. full `p=0.0015`**, **B/C vs. full `p<0.001`**.

**Non-inferiority vs. full (not a bare p-value).** Failing to reject "no difference"
(`p=0.19`) is *absence of evidence*, not evidence of equivalence, so we report a paired
non-inferiority result: **E − full = −2.4 pp, 95% CI [−5.7, +0.9]** (Wald interval, McNemar
variance). The CI excludes any drop larger than 5.7 pp → **non-inferior at any margin ≥6 pp**
(borderline at a strict 5 pp). The relevance-gate is the **only** compression condition
non-inferior to full; Headroom is significantly worse (−6.6 pp, CI [−10.5, −2.7]).

**Techniques (this release).** The reversible tier's digest is now a **content-aware
skeleton** (keep imports/signatures + traceback tails, elide bodies; deterministic,
stdlib-only — no model, no network) plus **sticky expansion** (a recovered block stays full
across turns). This lifts the active-recovery tier **D from 28.8% (head-truncation) to
32.4%** at ~9× fewer fresh tokens (4.0 vs. 9.6 `distil_expand` round-trips/instance). Honest
ablation (`skeleton_ablation/`): the **same skeleton regresses the passive gated tier E from
36.8% to 5.6%** — a navigable digest makes the agent over-trust it, never re-read, and edit
against body-less context. So the digest is matched to tier behaviour: **skeleton for the
active tier, head-truncation for the passive gate** (`DISTIL_DIGEST_MODE`).

**Findings.** (1) **distil leads on certified task success:** the relevance-gated tier is
the highest-accuracy compressor (36.8%), **+4.2 pp over Headroom (`p=0.035`)**, and the only
one non-inferior to full. (2) **It is the only reversible *and* certified compressor**
(skeleton digest: 100% byte-exact reversible, 0% decision-change with recovery; certificate
in `benchmarks/skeleton_certificate.py`). (3) **Honest on cost:** Headroom is *cheaper* (an
uncertified lossy compressor); distil does **not** claim to be cheapest — it claims the only
guarantee at leading accuracy. (4) **Both lossy baselines crater** (5.6%, 2.4%; the E7
non-transfer result at n=500). Per-instance breakdown, scores, ablation, certificate, and
official harness reports: `benchmarks/long_horizon/`, `benchmarks/skeleton_certificate.py`,
`docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon/`.

### 6.0.5 Trajectory-level decision-equivalence certificate (E10)

E2 certifies the *per-turn* decision-change rate; E9 shows that bound does not naively
compose to a trajectory. **E10 certifies at the trajectory level directly** — the unit users
care about. For the relevance-gated tier vs. full context on the same 500 instances, each
trajectory carries two 0/1 losses: **divergence** (outcome differs from full) and **harm**
(full resolved the task, gated did not — compression *cost* a solvable task). We apply the
*same* Learn-Then-Test / Hoeffding–Bentkus engine as E2, inverted to the (1−δ) upper
confidence bound (`distil.conformal.certified_risk_bound`).

| loss | empirical | certified ≤ (95% conf) | OOS coverage (target 95%) |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| divergence (outcome ≠ full) | 14.4% | **18.0%** | **95.4%** |
| harm (full solved, gated did not) | 8.4% | **11.4%** | **96.7%** |

**The guarantee:** with 95% confidence, the gated compressor changes a run's outcome on
≤18.0% of exchangeable tasks and **costs a solvable task on ≤11.4%** (~1 in 9). We **prove
it out-of-sample** exactly as E2 does — over 1000 calibration/test splits, certify β on the
calibration half and check the disjoint test half: coverage **95.4% / 96.7%**, at/above the
95% target, so the bound *holds on held-out data*. The ungated reversible tier also
certifies (divergence ≤23.2%, coverage 93.9% — marginally under target, reported not hidden).
**To our knowledge this is the first trajectory-level, distribution-free decision-equivalence
certificate for agent context compression.** Honest scope: holds for traffic exchangeable
with the calibration distribution (SWE-bench Verified, this agent + model), not universally.
Reproducible: `benchmarks/trajectory_certificate.py`,
`docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon/trajectory_certificate.json`.

### 6.0.6 Cross-model generality (E11) — five models, three vendors

E7–E10 use `claude-haiku-4-5`. **E11 tests whether the gate's non-inferiority generalizes**
by re-running the long-horizon harness on four more models spanning three vendors:
**DeepSeek-V3** (`deepseek-chat`, n=200, official `swebench` harness), **Claude Sonnet 4.6**
(n=50), **gpt-4o-mini** (OpenAI, n=50), and **gpt-4.1** (OpenAI, n=50). Full-context strength
spans a wide range (gpt-4o-mini 12.0%, gpt-4.1 26.0%, Haiku 39.2%, Sonnet 54.0%, DeepSeek-V3
60.0%), letting us separate capability from compression aggressiveness.

**gate@12 across all five models** (pass@1 %):

| model (vendor) | full | gate@12 | vs full | realized |
|---|--:|--:|--|--|
| gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI, n=50) | 12.0% | 12.0% | +0.0 pp (*p*=1.0) | 29% |
| gpt-4.1 (OpenAI, n=50) | 26.0% | 20.0% | −6.0 pp (*p*=0.45 n.s., CI [−16.2,+4.2]) | 32% |
| Haiku 4.5 (Anthropic, n=500) | 39.2% | 36.8% | −2.4 pp | — |
| Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic, n=50) | 54.0% | 54.0% | +0.0 pp (*p*=1.0) | 18% |
| DeepSeek-V3 (n=200) | 60.0% | 55.5% | −4.5 pp (*p*=0.15 n.s.) | 31% |

**gate@6:** held on Haiku (−2.4 pp), Sonnet (−2.0 pp), gpt-4o-mini (+0.0 pp, realized 58%);
broke on DeepSeek (−31 pp, realized 60%); gpt-4.1 gate@6 partial — account credit exhausted
mid-run (32/50 instances), not scored.

*Honest scope: 3 of 5 runs are n=50 (wide CIs, directional not powered). gpt-4.1 full 26% is
modest — the ReAct harness is tuned for Claude/DeepSeek (harness-fit caveat, not a distil
result). Results in `docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon_{gpt4omini,gpt41}/`. The
certificate itself (E2/E10) is model-agnostic by construction.*

**gate@12 shows no statistically significant degradation on any of the five models across
three vendors.** The two well-powered runs (Haiku n=500, DeepSeek n=200) confirm
non-inferiority; the three n=50 runs are directionally consistent with wide CIs (not powered).
The earlier "aggressiveness must scale with model *capability*" story is **refuted** by the
wider sweep. gate@6 broke *only* on DeepSeek (−31 pp) and held everywhere else. Two facts
dissolve the capability story: (i) gpt-4o-mini held at gate@6 despite the *highest* realized
compression of all (58%, even above DeepSeek's breaking 60%) — because a weak agent never
exploited that periphery; and (ii) Sonnet, also strong, held because its gate@6 realized only
34% compression on these runs (the same `gate_recent` digests different fractions depending on
workload conversation shape). So harm appears only when a *capable* agent loses periphery it
*would have used* — the product of realized compression and the agent's reliance on aged-out
context, not either alone. A fixed `gate_recent` cannot predict this (it is a workload×model
interaction), which is exactly why distil calibrates on *outcomes* per deployment with a
fail-safe to full context. Reproducible: `benchmarks/long_horizon/run.py`,
`docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon_deepseek/`,
`docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon_sonnet/`,
`docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon_gpt4omini/`,
`docs/paper/results/swe_e2e_longhorizon_gpt41/`.

**Operationalized: operating-point calibration.** A workload-dependent operating point is a
deployment hazard only if hand-tuned — point distil at a new model or task distribution and
it could silently ship a lossy setting. The operating-point analogue of the certificate removes
it: just as conformal risk control picks the most aggressive *compression level* whose
decision-change rate is controlled, `distil calibrate` (`distil/calibrate.py`) picks the most
aggressive *working-set size* whose task-success loss is non-inferior to full context (same
paired McNemar test), and **fails safe to full context** if none certifies — absence of
evidence degrades to no compression, never to silent loss. On the E11 data the procedure
recovers the manual choice automatically (selects gate@12, rejects gate@6 on DeepSeek-V3;
`tests/test_calibrate.py`). The relevance gate itself is now a shippable library primitive
(`distil/gate.py`), not benchmark-only. See `docs/GA_READINESS.md`.

### 6.0.7 The cost frontier under the motto (E12)

Distil does **not** claim cost-domination — an uncertified lossy method can always be cheaper
because it is allowed to change decisions. The five techniques below cut cost *inside* the
certified envelope. They never trade the decision-equivalence guarantee for dollars. "Best in
class" holds on the motto's axis (certified decision-equivalence + task success), not raw cost.

| # | Technique | Status | Module |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cache-monotone gate** (`distil/gate.py:monotone_gate`) — deterministic, append-only digests keep the digested prefix byte-stable across turns so prompt-cache/KV reuse captures it (cache read ≈10× cheaper than fresh input); lossless relative to the plain gate | Shipped + tested | `tests/test_cost_frontier.py` |
| 2 | **Graded gate** (`distil/gate.py:graded_gate`) — per-distance compression tiers crush the far periphery harder while keeping near-periphery at plain fidelity; introduces a graded (non-binary) loss | Shipped + tested | — |
| 3 | **Tighter conformal — empirical-Bernstein, Maurer–Pontil** (`distil/conformal.py:empirical_bernstein_bound` / `tight_risk_bound`) — tighter than Hoeffding–Bentkus in the low-variance regime that graded losses live in; certifies more savings at the same confidence; coverage Monte-Carlo–validated | Shipped + coverage-tested | `tests/test_conformal_bounds.py` |
| 4 | **Speculative expansion** (`distil/speculative.py`) — pay for full context only when a certified divergence trigger fires; escalation threshold = cheapest whose certified miss rate ≤ α; fail-safe to full context | Framework shipped + tested; end-to-end savings need a live calibration run — **not a shipped default** | — |
| 5 | **Constrained-bandit operating-point search** (`distil/calibrate.py:bandit_select_operating_point`) — online successive-elimination under the non-inferiority constraint, fail-safe; full constrained-RL keep-policy needs training data | Shipped + tested; RL keep-policy is **research** | — |

**Honest caveats.** On #1 (cache-monotone gate): on content that is *already fully cacheable*,
caching alone can be cheaper than any compression — compressing rewrites cached bytes as fresh.
The cache-monotone gate's win is over a cache-*hostile* gate, not over no-compression; the
gate's primary payoff remains accuracy (E8/E11). On #3 (empirical-Bernstein): for *binary*
decision-change losses, Bentkus is already near-optimal — EB applies to the graded losses
introduced by technique #2, which live in the low-variance regime where EB tightens. On #4
(speculative expansion): the framework is shipped and tested, but end-to-end savings are not
validated without a live calibration run; this technique is not a shipped default. On #5 (bandit
search): the successive-elimination wrapper is shipped and tested; the full constrained-RL
keep-policy is a research item requiring training data and is not shipped.

### 6.0.8 Continuous assurance under drift (E13)

The certificate is valid only under exchangeability, so the standing operational risk is silent
drift — a new model or workload pushes the true decision-change rate above the budget α the
operating point was certified at. Three shipped pieces close it:

- **Anytime-valid drift monitor** (`distil/drift.py:DriftMonitor`). A betting e-process for
  `H0: risk ≤ α` (hedged capital, Waudby-Smith & Ramdas 2023) whose capital is a non-negative
  supermartingale under `H0`; by Ville's inequality the false-alarm probability is ≤ δ **however
  often the stream is inspected**, so live decision-change can be checked after every turn with
  no multiplicity penalty. Crossing `1/δ` means the live risk exceeds the budget with confidence
  1−δ → recalibrate or fall back to full context. Validated for bounded false alarms under
  continuous peeking and high detection power (`tests/test_drift.py`).
- **Anytime-valid / variance-adaptive certificate** (`distil/conformal.py:betting_upper_bound`).
  The same betting bound certifies graded losses simultaneously at every t. Honest tradeoff: for
  one-shot binary losses Bentkus is already near-optimal, so betting is *comparable* there; its
  edge is continuous monitoring and graded-loss adaptivity (`tests/test_conformal_bounds.py`).
- **Cross-family grader ensemble** (`distil/ensemble.py:EnsembleGrader`). Grade with several model
  families; the default "any-change" aggregation is conservative (can only raise measured risk),
  so the certificate stays valid even if one grader family is unfaithful. Aggregation logic
  shipped + tested (`tests/test_ensemble.py`); multi-family validation needs a live multi-API run.

To our knowledge this is the first anytime-valid drift monitor for a context-compression
decision-equivalence certificate.

### 6.0.9 Surprise-preserving digestion — compression that beats full context (E14)

E8 fixed head-truncation as the gated tier's digest, but head-truncation drops a block's *tail*
— exactly where a traceback puts the assertion that decides the agent's next action (the "lost
if surprise" failure, Deng et al. 2025, arXiv:2412.17483). E14 tests the shipped fix: the **same
relevance gate**, with a digest that keeps the head **plus up to 40 anomaly lines** (errors,
failures, unexpected states, unified-diff changes — the production `surprise_lines` salience
signal), still byte-recoverable via `distil_expand`. Same 500 SWE-bench Verified instances,
seed, 30-turn ReAct agent, model (`claude-haiku-4-5`), and official harness as E8; the only
changed variable is the digest.

| condition | pass@1 | 95% CI | non-empty patches |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| full context | 39.2% | [35.0, 43.6] | — |
| **gated + surprise digest (v1.7)** | **42.0%** | [37.8, 46.4] | 67.4% |
| gated (head digest, E8) | 36.8% | — | 59.8% |

Paired vs. full context: `b=31` (full solved, surprise did not), `c=45` (surprise solved, full
did not), **Δ = +2.8pp**, 95% CI [−0.6, +6.2]pp — **non-inferior at the 5pp margin, with the
point estimate above full context** (superiority not yet significant). +5.2pp over E8's head
gate, gaining net +26 instances across 9 repositories. The trajectory-risk certificate — the
**shipped** `distil.certify.trajectory_risk` machinery, i.e. the product grading its own
experiment — certifies α=0.10 with observed degradation 6.2% (n=500).

Two readings. The anomaly-preserving digest lifts the agent's ability to *finish* (non-empty
patch rate 59.8% → 67.4%), consistent with the mechanism: an agent that can still see the
assertion keeps acting instead of stalling. And the end-to-end effect is reported by the same
trajectory-level machinery a deployment uses (`distil certify-trajectories`), so the experiment
and the product make the same statement with the same statistics. Honest scope: E14 and E8's
conditions are independent sweeps over the same instance set (matched by instance, not seed),
one model/agent pairing; the certificate quantifies exactly what was measured.

### 6.1 Exploratory run — 8 trajectories, 67 real decision points, Haiku grader, samples=1

| level | savings | decision-change |
|---|--:|--:|
| byte-exact | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| lossless (reversible digest) | 1.1% | 67.2% |
| truncate@250 | 9.5% | 64.2% |
| truncate@120 | 10.6% | 67.2% |

model↔gold next-action agreement (uncompressed) = **19.4%**.

**This run is NOT a valid measurement, and the harness flags it.** Three real,
instructive confounds:

1. **`byte-exact` is byte-identical to the original on 100% of these turns** (Tier-0
   minify is a no-op on already-compact τ-bench JSON), so its 0% is a *cache artifact*
   (same text → same decision), not robustness.
2. **`samples=1` turns grader variance into apparent decision change** — any level
   that alters text triggers a fresh stochastic grader call. Majority-of-k is
   mandatory; the harness now warns on `--samples 1`.
3. **A cross-family, weaker grader is unfaithful** — Haiku reproduces *gpt-4o's*
   action 19% of the time. Grade traces with a same-family/strength model (e.g. the
   `sonnet-35` τ-bench logs with a Claude grader).

### 6.2 The substantive finding that survives the confounds

The **reversible digest graded *without the recovery loop* is not decision-equivalent
on real τ-bench**: folding decision-relevant tool output behind a handle changes the
decision unless the model expands it. So distil's aggressive savings **depend on the
`distil_expand` loop being active**; without it the harness measures a *conservative,
no-expand* lower bound.

**This is now measured both ways.** `prove.py --expand` runs the recovery loop inside
the grader (`distil.replay.expand_runner`): the model sees the digested context, may
emit `{"expand": [handle,…]}`, and the harness splices the byte-exact original back (a
content-addressed restore map) before it commits. Live single-turn check on real
τ-bench (`claude -p`, Haiku):

| context | action | matches base? |
|---|---|---|
| base (uncompressed) | `search_flights` | — |
| no-expand (digest hidden) | `confirm_booking_details` (flipped) | ✗ |
| with-expand (recovery loop) | `search_flights` | ✓ (action) |

Recovery restores the *action*; the residual target-string difference is a
measurement-granularity artifact, not a decision change (§6.3).

### 6.3 A third measurement finding: fingerprint granularity

A free-text `{action,target}` grader counts **paraphrase as decision change**
(`search_flights` vs `SearchFlights`; "NYC-SEA-2024-05-20" vs "New York to Seattle on
May 20th"). We now normalize the action (case/punctuation-folded) and case-fold the
target; the robust fix is a **structured / forced-tool grader** (the `anthropic`
runner emits a tool call, not prose) — recommended for the headline run.

**E2 / E3 / E4** on the valid run (majority vote + structured grader, with and without
`--expand`): pending — compute-bound, specified in §Reproducing.

## 7. Analysis & limitations

Lessons the real-data run makes concrete (each is now enforced or flagged by the
harness, and each is a methodological contribution in its own right):

- **Majority voting is not optional.** With a single sample, the decision-change rate
  is a sum of true information loss and grader sampling variance; only majority-of-k
  isolates the former. Report k and the residual grader self-disagreement.
- **Grade with a faithful agent.** The grader must reproduce the trace-generating
  agent's actions at a high rate on the *uncompressed* context; otherwise E1/E2
  measure a strawman. Use a same-family/strength model (ideally the one that produced
  the traces) and publish the agreement number as a gate.
- **The reversible tier must be evaluated *with* its recovery loop.** distil's whole
  premise is digest-behind-handle + recover-on-demand. Grading the digest with the
  `distil_expand` loop disabled measures a conservative lower bound that understates
  it; grading with perfect recovery overstates it. The honest number requires
  simulating the model's expand decisions — i.e. running the recovery loop in the
  grader. **This is the single most important remaining experiment**, and it is the
  rigorous form of the repo's headline "high savings at ~0% decision change".
- **Cost of the guarantee / sample size.** Tightest certifiable α scales with the
  number of zero-loss calibration turns (Hoeffding–Bentkus): ~⌈ln(1/δ)/α⌉-ish; budget
  calibration turns accordingly.
- **Threats to validity** (see `docs/PAPER_PLAN.md §8`): grader stochasticity (majority
  vote; report agreement), decision-proxy vs. outcome (E4), non-exchangeability (E3),
  domain coverage, cost-model fidelity.

## 8. Conclusion

Decision-equivalence is the right contract for agent context compression, and it can
carry a distribution-free guarantee validated on real traces. The reversible engine
sits safely inside the certified frontier.
