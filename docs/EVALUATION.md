# Evaluation methodology

How we measure whether distil is safe to ship, and why the obvious metric
(compression ratio) is not the one we report against.

## 1. Compression ratio alone is meaningless

Token reduction and task success are not linearly related, and the relationship
can cliff-edge: a setting that looks fine on average can collapse resolution
rate outright. "On Problems of Implicit Context Compression for SE Agents"
([arxiv.org/pdf/2605.11051](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.11051)) found that 4x
compression collapsed SWE-bench resolution from 86% to 7% — not a gradual
decline, a cliff. Factory.ai makes the same point from the practitioner side
([factory.ai/news/evaluating-compression](https://factory.ai/news/evaluating-compression)):
compression has to be graded on whether it changes the agent's *next action*,
not on how small the context got.

Distil's rule follows from this: **every compression claim we publish reports
token savings and task-success delta together, at the setting we actually ship**,
never a peak ratio measured in isolation. A number like "38% smaller" with no
paired success-rate number next to it is not a result, it's an invitation to
find the cliff the hard way, in production.

## 2. distil's own cliff-edge: E7

We hit this failure mode ourselves. E7, an internal SWE-bench Verified
end-to-end experiment (`benchmarks/swe_bench_e2e/`), ran the full agent loop —
not a single-step proxy — under distil's *aggressive* lossy compression tier
and measured actual task resolution: **52% → 16%**. The **reversible** tier,
by contrast, held (56% vs. 52% full-context baseline). Per-step
decision-equivalence had passed; end-to-end task success still cratered under
the aggressive tier. That's the exact failure the literature above describes,
reproduced on our own harness.

We publish E7 as evidence, not confession. It's the reason the trajectory-risk
certificate and the fail-safe gate exist, and why distil's shipped default is
the conservative/reversible tier rather than the tier that scores best on a
compression-ratio leaderboard. If you turn off the safety machinery, E7 is
what you get back.

## 3. Live decision-equivalence: shadow mode

The trajectory certificate (below) is offline, run against a fixed corpus.
Shadow mode (`distil/shadow.py`) is the live check: it runs continuously on
real traffic, replaying **2% of requests** by default (`distil wrap --shadow`,
`0` opts out).

Each shadow sample is one of two kinds, at a 2:1 ratio:

- **A/B (2/3 of samples)** — replay the same turn with the original context
  and with the compressed context, and compare the model's decision signature
  (tool call + args, or response digest) between the two. This is the number
  people want: did compression change what the model decided to do?
- **A/A (1/3 of samples)** — replay the *same already-compressed* request
  twice and compare its decision signature against itself. This is not a
  compression measurement at all — it's the model's own sampling
  nondeterminism, measured on live traffic with a live model.

The reason A/A exists: a raw A/B agreement number is uninterpretable on its
own. If the model only agrees with itself 90% of the time under identical
input (temperature, tool-choice noise, provider-side nondeterminism), an A/B
agreement rate of 88% is not a 12-point compression problem — it's within the
model's own noise floor. `distil shadow-stats` reports the decomposition
explicitly: **raw A/B rate, A/A baseline rate, and the adjusted rate** (A/B
agreement relative to the A/A baseline), so a regression in the adjusted rate
means compression, not the provider having a noisy day.

Every shadow row is content-free by construction: a digest and both decision
signatures, never the underlying prompt or completion.

This A/A self-agreement control is ahead of current published practice.
ACON ([arxiv.org/abs/2510.00615](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00615)), Context
Codec ([arxiv.org/abs/2605.17304](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.17304)), and
Decision-Aware Memory Cards
([arxiv.org/abs/2606.08151](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.08151)) all evaluate
decision-equivalence, but none of them measure or subtract out the model's own
sampling nondeterminism first — which means a fraction of the harm they
attribute to compression is actually the model disagreeing with itself.

## 4. Trajectory-risk certificates

`distil certify-trajectories` (`distil/certify/trajectory_risk.py`) is the
offline statistical gate: run your eval suite twice, full context and
compressed, on the same tasks; feed in the matched pass/fail pairs; it returns
a distribution-free bound of the form **P(degradation ≤ α) ≥ 1 − δ**, refusing
to certify below a minimum sample size, and states its exchangeability
assumption in the certificate itself.

What it proves: on *this measured workload*, compression is very unlikely to
have cost you more than α percentage points of task success, at confidence
1 − δ. What it does not prove: that the same bound holds on a workload you
haven't measured. Transfer across workloads is not guaranteed — E7 is the
concrete demonstration of why that caveat is load-bearing, not boilerplate:
per-step certification on one workload does not imply end-to-end safety on
another. An anytime-valid drift monitor
(`distil.certify.trajectory_risk.drift_monitor`) flags when live traffic has
moved far enough from the certified distribution that the certificate should
be considered stale and re-run.

## 5. How to reproduce

- `distil shadow-stats` — live decision-equivalence, raw/baseline/adjusted
  decomposition, from real traffic collected by `distil wrap --shadow`.
- `distil certify-trajectories` — offline trajectory-risk certificate from a
  matched full-vs-compressed outcome file; see `distil certify-trajectories -h`
  for the input format.
- `benchmarks/swe_bench_e2e/` — the E7 harness (`run_all_agents.sh`,
  `run_all_scores.sh`, `aggregate.py`): runs the full SWE-bench Verified agent
  loop under each compression tier and scores real resolution, not a proxy.
- `benchmarks/PROVE.md` (`prove.py`) — decision-equivalence measured against
  real agent traces graded by a real model, avoiding the circularity of
  self-graded `DECISION:` markers.
- `BENCHMARKS.md` — the live-graded head-to-head numbers and how they're run.
