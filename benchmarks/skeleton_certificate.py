"""Certificate for the content-aware skeleton digest (distil/skeleton.py).

A reversible compressor must be judged in its *operating mode* — with recovery — not as if
its surface digest were the final context. This script reports both, so the distinction is
explicit and reproducible:

1. **Reversibility (byte-exact).** Every digested block must be recoverable byte-for-byte
   from its content handle. This is the reversible-tier contract; it is what makes the
   per-turn losses below recoverable.

2. **Decision-equivalence, raw vs. with-recovery**, on the offline 7-domain decision
   corpus (ground-truth ``DECISION:`` markers, :class:`DeterministicRunner`):
   * **raw** — grade the surface digest directly. The skeleton elides bodies / windows
     prose, so on an adversarial decision-in-noise corpus this is high (like *any* lossy
     method — truncation scores 39-100% here too). This is NOT the skeleton's operating
     mode; it is the "if you never recovered" lower bound.
   * **with recovery** — the runner expands handle-bearing blocks (the ``distil_expand``
     loop) before deciding. Because recovery restores the byte-exact original, every
     recoverable decision is preserved → decision-change collapses to ~0. This is the
     reversible tier's real, certified behaviour, and the mode E8 measures end-to-end.

The honest reading: the skeleton's safety comes from *reversibility*, not from the raw
digest being lossless. The conformal certificate (distil.conformal) correctly declines the
raw/irrecoverable skeleton as a lossy level; the reversible skeleton is decision-equivalent
by construction.
