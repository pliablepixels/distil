# Homebrew formula for Distil (PyPI: distil-llm).
#
# CANONICAL COPY: https://github.com/dshakes/homebrew-tap (Formula/distil.rb).
# CI's `bump-homebrew` release job rewrites the tap on every v* tag, so the tap
# is always current; this in-repo copy is a reference snapshot and may lag.
#
# To install:
#   brew tap dshakes/tap
#   brew install dshakes/tap/distil
#
# sha256 is for the v1.11.2 source tarball. To recompute for a new version:
#   curl -sL https://github.com/dshakes/distil/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.tar.gz | shasum -a 256
