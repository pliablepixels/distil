"""Cross-family grader ensemble — robustness to a single unfaithful grader.

Decision-equivalence is graded by a model that maps context to a canonical next-action
fingerprint (:class:`distil.replay.runner.AgentRunner`). A standing limitation of the
certificate is that every reported number uses *one* grader family, so a blind spot in that
family could bias the measured decision-change rate.

This module grades with several graders (ideally different model families) and aggregates their
per-turn change judgments. The principled default is **"any"**: a turn counts as a decision
change if *any* grader sees one. That choice is deliberately conservative — it can only *raise*
the measured risk, never lower it — so the Decision-Equivalence Risk Certificate built on top of
an "any"-ensemble loss stays valid even if one grader family is unfaithful (an unfaithful grader
can make us *over*-report risk and refuse to certify, never *under*-report and over-certify).
``"majority"`` and ``"unanimous"`` are available when over-conservatism costs too much savings.

Scope: the aggregation logic is implemented and tested here; running it end-to-end needs real
grader models from more than one family (the Anthropic/OpenAI/CLI runners already exist), which
is a live-API step rather than a unit test. Multi-family validation is a tracked GA item
(`docs/GA_READINESS.md`).
