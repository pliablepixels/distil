"""Auto-calibration of the relevance-gate operating point to agent capability.

E11 is the reason this module exists. The relevance gate's non-inferiority to full context
is real but the *operating point* is capability-dependent: the working-set size that is
non-inferior on a weak agent (claude-haiku-4-5: keep 6) costs **-31 pp** on a strong one
(DeepSeek-V3), which needs keep 12. Left as a hand-tuned constant, that is a silent-loss
hazard — point distil at a new model and you may ship a lossy operating point without
noticing. This module removes the hazard.

It is the operating-point analogue of the Decision-Equivalence Risk Certificate
(:mod:`distil.conformal`): the certificate selects the most aggressive *compression level*
whose decision-change rate is provably controlled; this selects the most aggressive
*working-set size* whose **task-success loss** is provably controlled, using the same paired
non-inferiority test the papers report (:func:`distil.certify.stats.mcnemar_noninferiority`).

Two production guarantees:

* **Most-aggressive-under-a-budget.** Among candidate operating points, pick the one that
  digests the most periphery while remaining statistically non-inferior to full context at a
  pre-registered ``margin``.
* **Fail-safe.** If *no* candidate is certified non-inferior, calibration refuses to compress
  and falls back to full context. The default is fail-closed: silence never ships loss.
