"""Speculative expansion — pay for full context only when divergence risk is certified low.

The idea, borrowed from speculative decoding: most turns are safe to run on cheap compressed
context; only a few actually need the full context to keep the agent's decision. A cheap
*risk score* predicts, per turn, whether the compressed decision would diverge from the full
decision. The controller escalates to full context only when the score crosses a threshold —
so cost is mostly-cheap-plus-occasionally-full instead of always-full.

The motto is preserved by **certifying the miss rate**: among the turns we did NOT escalate,
the rate at which the compressed decision actually diverges from full is bounded by a
distribution-free (1−δ) conformal upper bound (:mod:`distil.conformal`). The threshold is
chosen as the *least* escalation (cheapest) whose certified miss rate is ≤ α.

Scope (honest): this module is the controller + its certificate. It needs (a) a risk-score
function and (b) labeled calibration turns (compressed-vs-full decision) from your traffic;
producing those requires a live calibration run, which is why end-to-end speculative savings
are a tracked GA item (`docs/GA_READINESS.md`) rather than a shipped default. The control
logic and the certificate are implemented and tested here.
