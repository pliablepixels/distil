"""Incremental upstream→client relay for the sync HTTP servers.

The whole point of fronting an interactive agent is that tokens appear as the
model produces them. Buffering an SSE response start-to-finish turns
time-to-first-token into time-to-last-token, so this module relays the
upstream response chunk-by-chunk instead — while still returning the complete
buffered body to the caller for content-free accounting (shadow-mode decision
signatures). Chunked transfer framing is emitted when the upstream declares no
Content-Length (the SSE case); requires the handler to speak HTTP/1.1.
