"""Seamless proxy hot-swap: live wrap sessions pick up upgrades without a restart.

The problem: ``distil wrap`` historically ran the proxy as a *thread inside the
wrap process*. A ``pipx upgrade`` replaces the code on disk, but a running
interpreter can't reload itself — so picking up a new version meant restarting
the wrap, which kills the agent session with it.

The design (nginx-style zero-downtime handover):

  wrap (supervisor)                 proxy worker (subprocess)
  ───────────────────              ─────────────────────────
  owns the LISTENING socket  ──►   inherits the listener FD, accepts on it
  spawns / supervises              serves every request (same code path as the
  polls installed version           in-thread proxy: build_handler + server)
  on upgrade: spawn NEW worker ─►  new worker = fresh interpreter = NEW code,
  (same inherited FD)               accepts on the SAME socket — no port change,
  health-check via READY line       no bind race, no dropped connections
  drain old worker (SIGTERM)  ──►  stops accepting, finishes in-flight requests
                                    (non-daemon handler threads), flushes
                                    savings + shadow ledger, exits 0

Why this is safe and cheap:

* **Zero request-path cost.** The agent talks to the same localhost socket it
  always did; supervision is entirely out-of-band. The upgrade poll is one
  ``importlib.metadata`` read every 30 s in a daemon thread.
* **No handover gap.** Both workers hold the *same* listener FD during the
  overlap; the kernel delivers each new connection to exactly one ``accept()``.
  There is no unbind/rebind window and the port never changes, so the child's
  ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` stays valid for the whole session.
* **Fail-safe.** If the new worker does not report READY in time, it is killed
  and the old worker keeps serving — a broken upgrade downgrades to the old
  "restart when convenient" behavior, never to a dead session. If the
  supervisor itself cannot start, ``wrap_run`` falls back to the historical
  in-thread proxy.
* **State is on disk.** Savings ledger, shadow ledger, learn stats, restore
  store, gist cache — all persisted with advisory locks (POSIX). The new worker
  simply picks them up; nothing is handed over in memory.

POSIX-only: FD inheritance uses ``Popen(pass_fds=...)``. On Windows (or with
``DISTIL_HOT_SWAP=0``) the wrap keeps the historical in-thread proxy and the
existing version-skew warning.

Manual trigger: ``kill -USR1 <wrap pid>`` forces a handover now (used by the
test suite and handy after an upgrade if you don't want to wait for the poll).
