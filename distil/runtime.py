"""Genuine runtime savings — measure what *using* Distil actually saved.

The corpus numbers are a demonstration; this is the real thing. As live traffic
flows through the proxy/gateway, every compressed request's actual token
reduction is accumulated here and periodically flushed to the local savings
ledger — so `distil leaderboard` reflects *your own usage*, not a synthetic
benchmark. Content is never recorded; only token counts and the priced dollar
estimate. Federate the signed aggregate (`distil/telemetry.py`) and the
community number is genuine, verifiable savings too.
