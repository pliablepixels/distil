"""Salience protection — keep the needle, compress the haystack (model-free).

The decision-aware counterpart to entity protection: before a *lossy* strategy
crushes a block, we mark the spans that are most likely to carry the decision and
guarantee they survive — so aggressive compression stops dropping load-bearing
identifiers and directives.

Unlike syntactic entity protectors, salience here is a **model-free blend of three
signals**, and it operates at *line* granularity so the decision unit survives
together (e.g. ``notify_customer(PAY-12345)`` keeps the verb AND the target):

  1. PATTERN  — known identifier shapes (UUID, git sha, ``PREFIX-NNN``, email, IP, semver).
  2. ENTROPY  — high-information mixed-alnum tokens, so novel ID formats that no
                fixed regex anticipates are still caught (Shannon entropy + diversity).
  3. REFERENCE — tokens that recur across blocks are anchors the agent navigates by;
                a token referenced in two places is load-bearing, not noise.

This is not a competing heuristic to the certificate — it is a *frontier shifter*.
Protecting salient lines lowers the decision-change rate, so the conformal
certificate (:mod:`distil.conformal`) can certify a **more aggressive** level. The
guarantee still comes from the gate; this just moves where the gate says "safe".

No model, no network — a few hundred microseconds, so it stays in the request path.
