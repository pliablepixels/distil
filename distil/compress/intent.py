"""Query-aware salience — keep the tool-output lines the agent is actually asking about.

distil is a proxy, so at compress time it holds the agent's intent in the *same request*
as the output being compressed: the ``tool_use`` call that produced a ``tool_result`` (its
name + arguments literally name the needle — a grep pattern, a path, a symbol) and the
latest user turn. No post-hoc compressor (a shell filter, a content router, a vector finder)
has that pairing.

This module turns that intent into a set of salient terms and reports which output lines are
relevant. The keep is strictly **additive** in ``tier1.digest`` — query-relevant lines join
the never-dropped answer tier — so reversibility (the full block is always in RestoreStore)
and the decision-equivalence certificate are only ever *widened*, never weakened. A term that
matches most lines is not a needle, so it is dropped (selectivity guard); that preserves
compression when intent does not actually narrow anything.
