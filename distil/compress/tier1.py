"""Tier 1 — reversible digest behind a retrieval handle.

Large tool outputs / retrieved docs are replaced by a compact, *decision-aware*
digest plus a content handle. The full original is kept locally and can be
re-expanded on demand (`expand(handle)`), so this is lossless in effect.

The codec is decision-aware: any line the runtime cannot prove irrelevant is
preserved verbatim. The keep rules delegate to ``keep_policy``: the generic net
keeps DECISION: markers and error/failure lines, and each content kind adds its
own load-bearing lines (a test log's pass/fail summary, a traceback's frames, a
diff's hunk headers). The dropped span is folded behind a retrieval handle so
the full original is always recoverable.

On top of the per-kind keep decision, an outcome-aware dedup layer collapses
near-identical error/warn lines that differ only in an index/id: on a GREEN run
those errors did not cause the failure, so one sample per shape is enough signal.
