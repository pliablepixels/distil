"""Per-turn compression strategies, as (blocks, turn_index) -> blocks.

These are what the cache simulator runs. The contrast between `distil` and
`naive` is the whole point of technique #1: both shrink tokens, but `naive`
rewrites the cacheable prefix every turn and so destroys the 10x cache-read
discount, while `distil` keeps the prefix byte-stable and compresses only the
volatile tail.
