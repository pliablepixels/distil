"""Live AgentRunner backed by the Claude API — for billing-grade certification.

`decide()` renders a trajectory's blocks into a real Messages request and forces
a single structured decision via a strict tool, returning a canonical fingerprint
(action + target) of what the agent chose. Certification then compares that
fingerprint with and without compression — exactly as the offline
DeterministicRunner does, but against the real model.

Requires the `anthropic` SDK and credentials. Imported lazily so the core stays
dependency-free. NOTE: not exercised in this repo's offline test suite (no API
key); treat live results as UNVERIFIED until you run them against your account.
