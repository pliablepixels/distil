"""Expand-aware grading — measure the reversible tier *with* its recovery loop.

distil's premise is digest-behind-handle + recover-on-demand: a tool output is
folded to a marker ``<< +N lines, handle=XXXXXXXX >>`` and the model can pull the
original back with ``distil_expand`` when it needs detail. Grading the digest with
that loop *disabled* (the default offline path) measures a conservative LOWER BOUND
on decision-equivalence — it counts a flip even when the model would simply have
recovered the content. This wrapper closes that gap: it gives the grader the same
recover-on-demand ability, so the reversible tier is measured the way it deploys.

It is **runner-agnostic**: it drives any base runner that exposes ``_raw(system,
user) -> str`` (Anthropic, OpenAI/vLLM, claude-cli, smoke) through a text protocol —
the model either asks to ``{"expand": [...]}`` or commits to ``{"action","target"}``.
Resolved handles are spliced back from a content-addressed restore map and the model
is re-queried, bounded by ``max_iters``. Truncation levels carry no handles, so they
are unaffected (irrecoverable, correctly) — only the reversible digest benefits.

The restore map is derived directly from the ORIGINAL turn blocks: distil's handle is
``sha256(original_block_text)[:8]`` for each digestible (tool-output / retrieved)
block, so ``build_restore`` reproduces handle→original without re-running compression.
