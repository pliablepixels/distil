"""Trajectory-level risk certificate — certify what users actually care about.

The lesson of distil's own E7 experiment (and of the 2024–26 agent-compression
literature, e.g. arXiv 2412.17483, 2510.00615): a statistically valid PER-STEP
certificate — "the compressed context yields the same next action" — can pass
while END-TO-END task success collapses, because per-step fidelity metrics
systematically overpredict multi-step success. Certifying next-action
equivalence and implying task fidelity is a category error.

This module certifies the right invariant instead: the TRAJECTORY-level loss —
did the task still succeed end-to-end under compression? — using Conformal
Risk Control and Learn-Then-Test (Angelopoulos et al., arXiv 2208.02814) on
matched full-context/compressed runs of complete tasks.

Honest scope (stated, because a guarantee without its assumptions is
advertising):

* **Exchangeability.** The bound holds for future trajectories exchangeable
  with the calibration set. Agent workloads drift; pair the certificate with
  :func:`drift_monitor` (an anytime-valid e-process) and RE-CALIBRATE when it
  alarms — a static certificate silently loses coverage under shift.
* **The loss is the task outcome you measured.** ``degraded`` should come from
  a real end-to-end evaluation (test suite passed, task rubric met), not a
  proxy metric — proxies are exactly the failure this module exists to fix.
* **No adaptivity.** Trajectories used to tune the compressor must not be
  reused as calibration (that breaks exchangeability a second way); keep a
  held-out calibration stream.
