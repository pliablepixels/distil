"""Output compression — reduce the cost of the model's *generated* tokens.

Input compression (the rest of distil) shrinks what the model reads. This module
addresses the other side of the bill — output tokens cost ~4-5× input — with two
real, complementary mechanisms:

1. **Lossless output-on-re-entry digest** (`digest_output_blocks`). A long model
   answer becomes *history* on the next turn, where it is re-sent every step.
   We digest those large assistant/history blocks decision-aware and reversibly
   (same Tier-1 machinery as tool outputs), so a verbose past answer stops
   costing full price as context. Lossless, offline-measurable.

2. **Generation-side shaping** (`shape_request`). A verbosity-control directive
   is injected as a `role:"system"` operator message (provider-ToS-safe, not
   user-spoofable) so the model *emits* fewer tokens. This is lossy by nature —
   the wording changes — so it is **gated** (PAYG only, never on subscription/
   OAuth) and **measured**: `measure_output_savings` reports the token reduction
   *and* the rate at which the underlying answer is preserved, with a bootstrap
   CI. We never claim a reduction without checking the answer survived.
